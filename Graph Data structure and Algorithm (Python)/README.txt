• Implemented “Adjacent Matrix” (2-D array), “Adjacent Array” (1-D array) and “Adjacent list (linked list)” data structures to store graph data 

• Implemented “Dijkstra” (Greedy Algorithm) and “Floyd” (Dynamic Programming) algorithms by using data structures above for finding the shortest paths between each node in a graph 

• Analysed the time and space complexity of each algorithm on each data structure
