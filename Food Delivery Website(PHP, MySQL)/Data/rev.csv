My family and I have been here a total of 4 times and each time it gets worse. Our last time at Charr was a nightmare. The manager on duty (blonde female) was completely short w/us because we complained about our waiter who we saw drinking a beer and smoking a cigarette by his truck minutes before we sat down. Usually when you go out to a restaurant you don't want your waiter smelling like a bar. Our food took over 30 minutes to get to our table and it wasn't busy. No refills on drinks until I had to get up and ask for refills. The food is good, but that is not good enough. A professional wait staff and a nice manager would be a good idea for this place. The owner of Charr would have been very disappointed with the managers attitude."

"-iOeI18tVuwxFHcqCe--fQ","Carey","1WBkAuQg81kokZIPMpn9Zg","Charr An American Burger Bar","5","2014-12-22 00:00:00","My wife and I ate here because we were in the mood for 'fresh' hamburgers. When we arrived on a Sunday about 6:30pm, the place was almost completely empty. This scared me a little, but there was a local NFL game starting at that time (Cardinals vs Seahawks) and, it seems, everyone was at the game. I'm told the place normally has a wait to get in.

Inside, they have 4 large flat screen TVs (3 over the bar, 1 at the opposite corner) showing sports with closed captioning on (thank you!).

My wife and I each ordered burgers and she had a side of the Mac and Cheese.
My burger came with fries.

The hamburger buns are very unique. They are like a swirled garlic bread. However, there was really no noticeable garlic taste, which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. But each time I brought the burger up to my mouth, the aroma of garlic from the bread was quite nice.

The Mac and Cheese has elbow macaroni sitting a soup of a cheese blend that is more like how 'grandma used to make' then you might expect. It was, like the burgers, exceptional.

The fries are shoestring style (very thin, very crunchy) and everything tastes fresh (not frozen) and home made. The burgers are not uniform in shape or thickness, which tells me they are made by hand. Hallelujah!

The service was outstanding. The staff was extremely attentive. I noticed they have a 'Vernors Pound Cake' on the desert menu. Vernor's is a drink made in Detroit (where I was born and raised). I asked if the restaurant was Detroit-inspired and was told it's actually Brooklyn, New York-inspired and they really like Vernor's Ginger Ale in New York. 

They also have a root beer float on the menu, so I asked the staff if they offer a Vernor's float instead. (A Vernor's float is known by folks in Detroit as a 'Boston Cooler' and its no different than a root beer float, except you substitute Vernor's for root beer.)

They never heard of it before (not shocking, since no one outside of Detroit has ever heard of it) but they were more than happy to make one for me. And it was delicious!

My wife thought the ice tea she ordered tasted a little off, but she didn't say anything to the staff. I have no doubt they would have made it right if she brought it to their attention. 

She also ordered the Vernor's Pound Cake for desert. She thought it was too rich for her liking, but it wasn't bad by any means.

It appears the three restaurants beside each other are all owned and run by the same entity. There is Charr, then a pizza place (Isa's Pizza) and then a fine dining restaurant called Aiello's East Coast Italian.

There were plenty of items on the menu I wanted to try, such as baby back ribs and a grilled chicken sandwich. The pizza served next door looked good and Aiello's also looks like a nice place for us to try as well.

So we have four reasons to go back (try each of the other two restaurants, try other menu items at Charr, and if worse comes to worst, we would definitely go back to Charr and have REAL, fresh handmade burgers again! If I was going to open my own burger joint, this is similar to how I would do it.  There's only so many fast-food burgers one can ingest before desperately craving something that isn't factory made and doesn't require a loan to pay off. (our complete total for dinner and desert was $39 after tax. Quite reasonable and fair considering the quality and quantity of the food and the excellent service we received.)"
"-jDtacIrN9x4c3BDD5xkGQ","Liberty","n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA","GameWorks","2","2016-01-11 00:00:00","Facility is similar to a Dave and Busters but with a larger arcade area and a bar instead of restaurant.

Games: Okay selection. Typical games like carnival style, ticket winning games, arcade racing, two rhythm and very few Japanese games. My personal favorite is Taiko Drum Master. Some o the games are rather old and as maintain as other places.

People: For families and children. The kids could be worst and parents have them in line as best they can. Something about the place and the energy causes the parents to be very impatient and irrational.  Probably some kids are pestering their parents and they are at their wits end. The parents are only interested with their kids and they will interrupt your game if their kids want to play. Teenagers are just as bad. ""Every man from himself"" is what this place is like. That happen twice in one visit.

(Specific example, we waited in like for about 1/2-1hr for a game. Then a parent interrupted us when we were playing the game in the beginning and we were like fine. After a while we left and came back. Then we played again after waiting in line for [1/2-1hr] not interrupting the previous player but someone ask us to leave again.)

Arcade is for family which is great but the parents aren't gamers and have zero gaming etiquette.

Staff: Attentive and do what they must. About what you expect.

Come here if you have children. Maybe if you want to go from machine to machine. Not if you want to progress in the game or beat it."

I've had multiple trips to this place and their saving grace is that the bartenders and wait staff is usually extremely pleasant.  Tonight they were very inattentive and seemed to ignore me for the most part.  There were some ride and obnoxious people at the bar that took a lot of their attention and a motorcycle gang called ""Switchblade Club"" that occupied the outside area.  The kitchen was slow at turning things around.  Also I was sad to learn that the were it of the daily special which was the chicken pot pie.

It was restaurant week and I can only assume that it was their first time participating judging by the fact that they ran out of half of the items on their menu.  The 3 things we wanted to order- guess what were out.  And the poor maybe a day over 16 year old waitress had no idea how to handle that.  We wanted the oysters, we were told they were out, so we said we take the chicken wings and guess what, they were out too!  So, of the appetizer choices we were forced into a crab cake.  This crab cake was mediocre at best. Crusty on the outside like a potato cake and mushy in the middle.  Gross.  We received potato pancakes with our meals that looked exactly like the crab cake- and just as disgusting.  When some older gentleman that I can only assume was an owner came by to check on us he noticed I had barely touched the potato cake.  When he asked me if I liked it, I began to respond with a ""not so much"" look on my face and he quickly ran off before I could even share my feedback with him.  This place needs to get it together. You obviously weren't ready for restaurant week or a serving food in general."

I've been here before and the service on the restaurant side is less than desirable.  My most recent visit started of course walking to the front to be seated even though the tables are empty.  I was seated at a booth and there were crumbs.  As though the table was wiped down but some debris was left behind.  Adjacent to my booth was another booth with dirty plates/drinks etc. (like everyone placed the dirty dishes at one table to gather together).  Waitress proceeded to ""handle"" the dirty dishes then bring me water.  Didn't see her wash her hands, but she may have.

Food comes (not too long of a wait) and it's missing some stuff.  No biggy, just said hey, missing this and this.  I would of told the guy who delivered the food but he said ""food"" left the tray on the table and quickly left.

Keep in mind I'm still missing stuff from my food, the waitress has been told, then she goes to other tables.  Kind of hard to eat my salad without dressing.  I wait and get it, no big deal.

Food was ok, depending on what you get.  Better off eating elsewhere then going here to play games (assuming you have kids like me)

Happy Yelp community?!?!?! Lol"

Unfortunately, tonight I chose delivery and ordered the Carnivore Ramen. When it was delivered, everything was there, but the contents were far below what I expected in quality. The noodles definitely did not appear the Ohio City Ramen that was promised on the menu, but appeared to be just grocery store spaghetti. All of this aside, the ramen was still poorer quality than I would have expected. The flavor and the contents were nothing special, and this will not jump to mind as a place to go for ramen in the future. Portion was a lot smaller than I would have imagined for the price.

I'll probably give this place another chance when I have the time to go in person, but first impressions do not have me excited to return for the food."
"0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg","Roger","n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA","GameWorks","2","2015-07-07 00:00:00","Saw a Groupon special for these guys. 20 bucks for an all day play card plus a 10 dollar gift card. I immediately grabbed 2 of them for my 2 boys ages 13 and 10. Thought it was an awesome deal until we showed up on a saturday. Yes I can understand that it was gonna be busy because of the fact that it was a saturday but that's not my gripe.

My gripe is that a lot of the games were not working. I would say about 40 percent were out of order. Even some of the newer games like the tank one my youngest noticed you can only go forward and cannot reverse so he was stuck behind a wall the whole game not able to do anything but get shot at. Another gripe is that other parents had the same idea so of course my kids had to wait for their kids to get off a game once they ran out of lives but in most cases, they would just keep swiping their card basically just hogging the game the whole time. There should be some kind of limit on how many times you can continue on an all day play pass for they can literally stay on a game the whole day which is rude in my opinion.

I also understand that since we had the unlimited play card it wouldnt generate any game tickets for obvious reasons. This did not bother me at all. Again, since some of the games were out of order, the kids tried to make the most of it. Even the standard interactive games like the basketball shot one only 4 out of the 6 was working but technically only 2 was worthy of playing due to those having a decent amount of balls to play with while the others had only 2 or 3. Looking around I saw some of the balls were stuck on top of the actual arcade. 

After about 90 minutes of playing the same games over and over again my kids were bored already to the point they just wanted to go home. Memo to the Gameworks staff. Dont you guys have some kind of technician that is on the clock repairing those games that are broke? At least a person that can keep the basketballs in order on the basketball arcade?

I am so disappointed from our visit that I dont see any reason to come back here. You guys should change your name to ""Gameswork"". Because after coming here I am left scratching my head thinking do any of the ""Games Work?""

First game we play and it takes our 9 credits and doesn't work. Well that was great. Credits do cost money it's not like we were on some play for so many hours thing. Things were pretty cool from there until we got to the giant fish reel. The reel says we won 70 tickets awesome, the box even says we were awarded 70. So of course since 70 is a lot lets play again. This time the giant reel says we won 60 tickets! Child is super excited and I look down at the box and it says 15 tickets awarded. WHAT?! So I got robbed of 9 credits and at least 45 tickets. Never thought to watch any of the other times we won tickets so who knows how many Game Works really stole from us. It was over all a good time, just left a bad feeling knowing we got ripped off."

I'm convinced these places justify their high burger prices by adding the descriptor ""gourmet"" to their name, and offering a variety of burger options. Who would have imagined that $10+ for a cheeseburger would be a good deal??

We ordered the American Turkey burger, Charr Burger with cheese, and the kid's meal chicken fingers. We thought the turkey burger was a bit on the dry side. It comes with a garlic aioli, which was flavorful, but there was a lot of it! The cheeseburger was ordered medium, and was more medium-well. It was good, though. The little one loved the chicken fingers and all of us devoured the truffle fries!

Attentive service, nice ambience. Decent food."

Upon entering, you load a Gameworks card which will cost you a one time $2 fee. Then, you can add points into the card. The deal I purchased was 120 points for $22. 

On Tuesdays they have double ticket earnings which is a great deal! I enjoyed playing everything from ski ball to Mario kart to pinball and basketball. They offer so many classic arcade games for few points. Ski ball was only 2 points per turn so you can imagine how far your $22 go. Plus, you received so many tickets for playing that the prizes to choose from at the end were not just limited to candy."

As soon as you arrive they start you off with a complimentary order of bruchetta which is excellent and a very nice touch. 

For appetizers we ordered the Buffalo Mozzarella, made with beautiful fresh ingredients, it was amazing. I suggest that you ask them to add a bit of balsamic to the dish, a reliable source tells me that the previous chef use to serve it this way. We also ordered the calamari, which was very disappointing. I love calamari and I didn't even finish the plate. Wow, I can't believe that there was calamari in front of me and I didn't eat it! It was very chewy and not enjoyable, it tasted like something you'd pickup at the food court. 

For our main course my wife had the filet mignon and I had the lobster pasta. The filet was uninspiring and a bit salty and the lobster pasta evening more disappointing. The pasta was served with a lobster bisque for the sauce, a well done lobster bisque is one of my favorite things. Unfortunately this was very bland and uninteresting. The pieces of lobster in the pasta were few and far between. 

For dessert I had the chocolate lava cake.Chocolate cake is one of my favorite things on earth. Again this dish lacked flavour and any sort of punch or excitement. 

Overall I must say the meal was very uninspiring and with so many other great options available I will not be back to Lucca any time soon."

It seemed like an arcade graveyard. 50-60% of the games either didn't work, didn't accept the card, or were just plain not on. I saw on at least 3 different occasions where a 2 person shooter game only had 1 gun..  We sat down on another 2 person game, and the start button only worked for one player. The calibrations were off on a couple games (shooting far left, and the crosshairs are all the way over to the right).  The basketball games with their sad, deflated basketballs, with pieces of the ball literally falling off. The one football game that did work, again had sad deflated footballs. However, I did see Tom Brady playing the game, and those deflated footballs really sent him over the top for the high score. This place is literally the biggest joke, and saddest excuse for an arcade that I've ever seen. This is Las Vegas... get your stuff together!  

Ps...  GameWorks management, don't bother responding to apologize, and urge me to check out your rewards program. We will never set foot in here again. And for the sake of everyone's sanity..  Take your business off of Groupon. You're not set up to be anything more than an old, tired, rundown graveyard for games. Time to close the doors, and replace it with a Dave and Busters."

"1qnjqsXnU6Bg39mr6LYhyQ","Torrance","n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA","GameWorks","1","2014-08-04 00:00:00","Okay before i start this let me say that I AM glad that gameworks is back.  After nearly 3 years i really really....REALLY missed having it around.

Now let me begin...

First off, this place was a bigger letdown than i could've ever imagined. There couldn't possibly be any more than 45 arcade games on the game floor. The space that could be used to fit more game machines is currently taken up by over-optimistic restaurant space, unused party/banquet rooms and fancy looking walls. As it is at any gameworks a nice percentage of games were broken....but the difference between this gameworks and the others is that there's not much else to choose from....remember there's not even 50 machines on the floor which leads to my next complaint....a 2-3 person line to play literally any game on the floor. I'm not one to complain about waiting his turn, but this is a first for me at a gameworks. Arcade favorites like sonic the fighters, afterburner climax, marvel vs. Capcom, mortal kombat, street fighter, need for speed, f1 Ferrari challenge, and many many others are all MISSING from the roster. They used to be at the gameworks on the strip....i just don't understand why they wouldn't be here. The ticket/prize games are usually separated at most gameworks locations. Since this one is soooo tiny, they all just blend together. The prize redemption area is soooo small. I was tripping over small children and a couple of large, buff, angry dudes. Very uncomfortable...i never even got to choose my prize. More tickets for next time i suppose... Oh, and gamer beware. Many games will deduct points and the game will never acknowledge that you payed. Luckily the managers were able to see the cards swipe history and refund the card. in comparison to any other gameworks in the country....This game floor gets an F. 

The e-sports room is passable....literally...you can pass right by it and not even notice it's there. Its a decent price to rent an xbox and tv but honestly the game roster is small. I'm not sure if you can bring your own or not. Theres a total of 4 stations with televisions. Imho they should have at least 7 or 8 but that's just my two cents. They have a 60pc lan party...which is 40 less than what was advertised last year. Which reminds me...they told us on the gameworks facebook and website that there would be a laser tag arena.....which...there is none. Very disappointing. The e-sports will definitely bring in revenue. It just needs more games and console/tv stations. The e-sport section gets a C.

The bowling ally and pool table area is nice. And it has its own bar which is cool since you don't have to leave to goto the game floor for a drink. You rent your shoes at the door. The alley lanes are very narrow compare to say...the station casinos. They're basically miniature bowling lanes....i haven't played on the lanes yet so its not really fair for me to review it. Id say a B just because it exists.

Lastly, the overall service and restaurant. I didn't eat at the restaurant yet...and i don't believe i ever will. Allow me to explain. I asked the bartender at the bowling center for a glass of water. He immediately tells me itll be ""a while"" before he can serve me the water. Which is fine....note that he had a group of 3 people to serve before me and as soon as he was done serving them...""a while"" never came for me. No biggie. I guess good service is reserved for paying bar patrons. After spending 100 on points (which is ridiculous. I've never spent more than 40 bucks at any gameworks and i usually get hours of entertainment!) you'd think you would be treated half as decently as a hole in the wall bar. Later on i noticed i was hungry and i wanted something light, so i grabbed some wetzels pretzels which isn't far from gameworks.....BIG MISTAKE. I was just about halfway through my pretzel and walking back into gameworks when i was met with the most absurd statement: ""we don't allow outside food. Sorry."" excuse me? I just spent how much money.....to play broken games?! I'm sure you wont mind if i finish my pretzel while i walk through your precious, oversized restaurant past your pitiful, undersized gamefloor, and get in my car. Service gets a D. 

Worst gameworks experience I've ever had. I have been going to various gameworks locations since i was 9 years old. I'm 26 now. I've never seen anything like this. It's as if they only care about making money. I wish sega never sold gameworks to espn. I hope this helps them make better decisions in the future and fall back to their former glory! Long live gameworks!

  i give them six months to add more games before i write them off my hangout spots list."

It was date night but there was a long pause between dinner and the movie so we tried our hand at gaming. We walked through, a lot of seemingly unsupervised teens but no issues and a few families. We decided on pool and beers. It was $5 per hour for the table and about $6.50 per beer, but of course. The table was a little rough but we weren't auditioning for ""The Color of Money"" so no worries. If the bartender had been more attentive (or the bar back to be specific), we'd have spent a lot more to keep the beer flowing. It also took a bit to check out and settle the table tab, because again, the Bar Back was preoccupied with... something, whatever it was, keeping his conversation with fellow employees on point and fairly oblivious to customers. The bar was pretty empty for a Friday evening. Overall,  an 'okay' experience for a limited one."

Nearly 10 minutes after we were seated, I try to flag someone down through the front window, and finally our waitress arrived and took our orders. She apologized for the delay, said something about how she had to train someone to enter food orders. It didn't seem exceptionally busy, so I think they just forgot we were seated. I thought this might be an isolated incident, but then I watched another man with a small child get seated near us a half hour later and end up leaving before a waitress ever arrived because the child couldn't wait any longer to eat... I see from the reviews other people have had similar experiences. Maybe the wait staff they're training will improve the service here, but it wasn't great when we went.

The reason I am giving 3 stars is the food. The Carolina burger was delicious... The sauce and bacon were savory, the garlic knot bun was perfect. Their fries were great and they give you plenty of them.

I'd recommend this place for the food, but expect to wait for it."

My boyfriend and I went last night, because I had a craving for their pita and hummus (they put raisins and nuts of some sort in their pita, it's delicious). While we were waiting for our food, we decided that we would like a glass of water. 

Bampot has a tank of water at the front, and you serve yourself. Usually this works out great, but last night when we arrived, they were out of cups. So we asked our server if he could bring some out. He said sure thing... five minutes later, he still hadn't brought them out. We weren't asking for him to do anything particularly time-consuming, we just wanted a vessel to fill with water to drink. 

So we asked another employee (this took awhile, because employees are almost always at the back, not out where the customers are, so we had to wait for someone to come out). She said sure thing, she'd grab some right away... again, no cups. 

Finally, a third employee came out (she's actually one of the co-owners of the place) and we asked her for cups. She was able to provide, for which I was thankful. 

Nonetheless, getting a glass of water should not be a 25 minute process, and for that Bampot has lost a star."

Food: The food there is okay. Pricing is alright for the portions you get. I wouldn't eat here again. I would just grab food somewhere in the plaza. 

Location: Great area, located right next to the movie theater. You get the best of both worlds. Teenagers, kids and adults can all enjoy a movie then come here afterwards. 

Games: Variety of games to play. From winning tickets or just playing multiplayer. Most of the games are up to date and new. They still have some of your old school arcade games as well. A small bowling alley is located inside and a cool ride inside as well that is extra money. They even have one of those motion rides where you can seat yourself.

Overall, not too bad but still feels like they are missing something."

I ended up ordering delivery through UberEats. First, it was quick. Took about 30-35 minutes, which is less than most pizza delivery. I ordered a Korean bulgogi bowl, Thai steak bowl, the Yuzu fries and a child's chicken teriyaki and pb&j skewer. My Thai bowl was REALLY good. There was a sufficient kick from the fresh ginger (but I'm a wimp when it comes to spice). I also tasted my husband's Korean bowl. It was really good, but, it didn't taste like any bulgogi I've ever had. Again, however, it was so good that I'd order it again. I tasted my kids' chicken teriyaki and I appreciated that it tasted like -real- chicken teriyaki. My kids generally eat kid sized portions of adult food so I love places that offer that. The prices are super reasonable. At first glance, the portion was small but I was satiated. I'll definitely return."

Easy parking.  Great ambiance.  Nice patio with a fire pit.  Got seated promptly.  Good start.  Water came.  Weren't familiar with the menu so we didn't order immediately. 
Took a long time for the server to come back.  My water glass was empty again. We ordered a burger with avocado extra ($1).  Our menus were different and it wasn't clear that fries came with your order. It does in most places.  Ordered a flat-iron steak sandwich with bleu cheese---very good.  Enough for two small appetites.  The burger was overdone; no avocado, and a dried out bun.  A pile of ""truffle"" fries were placed in the middle of the table.  No dipping sauce (most upscale places offer that).  Wait staff was scarce in an almost empty restaurant.  Had to leave the table and go into the restaurant from the patio to get a check.  Commented that I felt invisible.  The waiter chuckled (wrong emotion). He gave us a small discount.  One can run up a big check here when you add in drinks and side orders of fries. But the quality does not justify these prices.   We are very generous tippers when service is good.  Our tip:  $0.00.  Another tip: Avoid this place.

Finally, a friend shopping at the nearby Safeway ran into a customer buying truffle oil spray (an employee from Charr).  They spray the oil on the friends--voila truffle fries. 
Can't imagine this place surviving with service and practices like this to go with high prices."

Not to mention her constantly leaving the stand to talk in a huddle with her other rude coworkers who I over heard talking about how some new employee wouldn't last and would be gone within a week.

The options, it appeared, were either a Japanese restaurant which the counter attendant at Bruno's said was not too bad, or Maxim. Well, we searched trusty Yelp and Maxim's was described as a Cafe serving French food. That was exactly what I was craving for and so we went in.

The lady asked me, in Cantonese, how many people and I was taken aback for a quick moment. I then realized this could be the same Maxims near my home...great for cakes, but so-so on everything else.

Service is awful here, in that it is very slow. They also do forget things. We came here Saturday around 3-ish so it wasn't prime time exactly. The food on the other hand was okay. I had the chicken which was covered in a great gravy, served with crunchy green beans (just the way I like them). My bf had the fish and chips which tasted like the best microwave oven fish ever! Crispy and crunchy on the outside, and fluffy white fish meat on the inside. The fries were yummy too!

Of course, we had the cakes for dessert and my fave is the Strawberry Meringue and Strawberry Shortcake:)

Overall though, I wouldn't recommend this place if you're hungry or if you're in a rush. The good thing is if you just want to be left alone and not have server's coming to see if your cup is empty or if you want more food, then this is your place.

They do serve alcohol (white and red wine) although there is no menu for it. Also, my bf originally wanted the kids menu fish and chips portion as he wasn't hungry, but they wouldn't accommodate which meant we got the regular serving (2 HUGE pieces of fried fish)."

The atmosphere is fun (punny cocktail names galor) but also a little strange. Despite being very obviously Japanese-inspired (decor, origami instructions on the coasters, descriptions of Japanese terms on the menu), the staff responded as if offended when my friend asked for chopsticks with her teriyaki rice bowl. 

My yakitori was tasty, but despite getting two different skewers, they tasted very much the same. So much so I'm a little convinced that they mis-made my order. I was also missing any hint of potato with my fried chicken skewer (a misnomer, since both of my skewers where fried chicken), despite it being in the description. My vegetable skewer (which was actually still chicken?) came with the same small side of veggies as the fried chicken skewer.

The portions are also extremely small. Despite spending over $7 on my 2 skewers, I left Yuzu pretty hungry."

Some of us received our food and found that the food was different from what we ordered. The server just say they ran out and did not inform us before hand.  

Also, the tip was calculated on the bill already and I honestly think the service wasn't worth the 15% paid!

I met a friend here for lunch and we were promptly seated. Our waitress was really nice and very attentive... drinks always refilled without having to ask and our order was taken quickly. She even gave us drinks in to-go cups after we paid our bill. Nice touch.

As for the food... it's so-so. We had some wings for appetizers, kind of small, not that juicy, nor were they spicy. But they came out fast... my guess is that they're warming them up rather than deep frying them.

I ordered the grilled Mahi Mahi. The description said it was cooked in a garlicky butter sauce but I couldn't taste it. It was rather bland. I think I picked a meal that was too healthy... it just lacked flavor.

The manager stopped by once to make sure everything was ok. The keyword is 'once'! That's a good thing in my book!! There are too many restaurants where the manager stops by 4 or 5 times interrupting your meal / conversation... once is all you need. Plus this guy looked a little scary but he was really nice.

I forgot to ask how my friends lunch tasted, but it looked pretty delicious. I wish I ordered what he had (some kind of burger).

We were a little early for our reservation, so we sat at the bar. The bartender was really nice and lively. I ordered a cocktail off their menu and it was pretty good. 

When we sat down for our meal it took some time for our server to get to us. She came to us and asked if we had been helped since we already had drinks. I guess the hostess didn't inform her?  We ordered crab cakes for our appetizer, the portabella burger with truffle fries for me and steak with marsalla sauce with potato cake and asparagus for the boyfriend, and bread pudding with Bourbon blueberries for dinner. This is the reason I'm giving this place 3 stars: service was really slow! Another couple sat next to us after we were seated and they got their food before us. I'm not sure if it was because of the steak we ordered, but it was a long time until we got our main course. The actual food tasted good, but nothing to die for really. Also, their tap water tasted a bit off. Maybe it wasn't filtered? Eek..
Just like this rating, my experience at Charr was A-Ok."

Very small areas, everyone was cramped tight and I almost lost my composure in there due to the fact that the arcade area is so small and when playing skee ball was afraid to play with confidence due to trying to a avoid bumping in to someone while playing. Lines for a lot of games and not many choices to pick and play from made it not fun. Will not be coming back spent 27$ for 20 min of very annoying and frustrating entertainment.

I do not understand the poor reviews of this place.  Good service, hot good food, relaxing time.

OK, now for the meat of it. No pun intended.

I arrived a tad late in the evening.  Fairly busy.  I asked for a table because I don't do booths.  I just don't.  The only tables they had were pulled together.  The hostess went out of their way to pull a table loose and set it up for me.

I was quickly attended to by the server, Megan.  Top notch. I already had my choice made, a nice penne dish with the Italian salad.  The salad showed up about the same time my water did, which was very fast.

Meagan brought me a couple of wine samples and I picked a nice cabernet.

The penne came out at just the right time, piping hot and fresh. Megan made sure my water never went dry.  She was very attentive.

When I finished the penne Megan gave me a run down of the deserts.  I had the seasonal panna cotta, cooked custard with raspberries.

OK, I get it.  Chains are not always cool.  I much prefer local eateries, and the occasional dive.  But I like Carrabbas.  Their food is prepared the way I prepare things at home.

Megan did an excellent job.  If you have the opportunity to go to Carrabas be sure and ask for her and tell her Bud recommended her."

This time was horrible. There were 3 tables in the restaurant and it took over 30 minutes to get food to our table. Both the sliders and charr burger, ordered medium, we well done and too dry to eat. They offered to make new burgers, but since it took 30 minutes to get our food, there was not enough time to wait for them to make new food.

The table next to us also had overcooked burgers and were also upset.

Too bad, we live close, but would rather make the drive to Delux."

Keep in mind as an adult the games should be the second reason for coming to this place and everything else ie food, drinks, the company youre with should be first. If the first is of good quality then the value of the games or their working conidition should  be second. 

With all of that said i always have a great time. Their happy hour, i think they have two, always hits the spot and the food is a great price and the quality is better than the strip for some items.  I kept it simple and just got the bbq bacon burger. I know, but im a burger guy. It was one of the best I've had. Sometimes you get them and they are outrageously big or dry or pricey, but this one was phenomenal.  The bartender was great at making a Cadillac margarita and quick with the food and any refills.  Forgot her name but shes on the younger side. Fun to converse with.

Save your cash and go some place else. It gets 2 stars cuz like I said the ""Atmosphere"" is nice = sometimes there are really pretty girls there and my sons stare at their...

The bun was burnt stiff on one side and the burger, and while good in theory, was ok at best.  Definitely could have done better.  I just don't understand why these places try and get fancy and butcher an American classic.  I don't need a fancy bun, especially if it's burnt, and if you aren't going to season the meat, at least make up for it in other areas.  The fries and southwest sauce was pretty good though.

On another note, there was a cold seafood bar near the kitchen, so I'm not even sure what theme they are going for here.  I can get surf and turf somewhere else, not at a burger joint.

If I lived close, I would give it another try, but don't expect it to blow you away.  Just another trendy burger joint in my honest opinion."

First, the bar area really needs a good cleaning and a paint job, it's really dirty.

Also, I know they have items on the menu for dogs, but to be sitting inside and someone walks their dog through well to me that is not cool in a restaurant.

We ordered a beer and the bartender was doing double duty waiting on tables outside.  After about 15 they took our food order.  

The wait time wasn't horrible but it could of been better.  I had the Bourbon Chicken which was good and my husband had the Ramen something or other.  His looked like soup and had a skewer of beef.  I tried it and it was just OK.  He left hungry and we ordered a pizza on the way home.

We keep forgetting to go when there are large sporting events... but this is really a sports bar with a larger than expected menu.

You have 4 options of seating... the bar... tables / booths... couches... recliners.

The tables at the couches are a bit too tall for me... it feels like the kiddie table... so we stick with a regular table if possible.

Service varies... sometimes the staff could care less... but there are 2 waitresses that are really good with refills and check backs.

Tonight we started with the cheese board... never enough bread... more than enough ""stuff"" for 3 or 4 people.... strong brown mustard that never feels at home with the Brie or the Goat or the Cheddah... but over all a good $10 buy

Our favorite for a while was the deviled eggs... oh the joy of great bacon!

Hubby's fish and chips were OK... not stellar... but good.

My black and blue burger was a perfect medium with a nice amount of grilled onion and just enough blue cheese.

We were too stuffed for dessert and sat back and marveled at the table full of beer bongs... almost as amazing as the group sitting outside by the fire in 33 degree weather... but this is a beer joint after all!"

I purposefully waited to write this since we wanted to re-try a couple of other places nearby for comparison.  We had 2 wedge salads, 2 burgers, an order of onion rings and 3 beers.  $60.  In the next two weeks we went to a nearby sports bar/Italian place and a brewpub.  For similar quantities, the price was $35 at one place and $38 at the other, both similar quality.  I have a hard time justifying the higher price tag, especially considering how loud it was at Charr, it was difficult to have a conversation.  The beer selection is good, but overpriced as was the case with everything.  Doing a la carte will be a tough sell when that is not what everyone else does.  We may return but not often unless the value gets better.  I wish them well but would encourage them to consider some changes that will price them more competitively."

When we got the bill, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that craft beers are $3/pint during Happy Hour.  The selection was above average...esp at that price!

I had the Turkey Club with tater tots.  It was ok.  Nothing wrong, nothing special.  I was excited to see that it included their signature deviled eggs as I am a deviled egg fan.  Unfortunately, they were not to my liking.  My husband enjoyed his burger.  So, that may be the way to go.

Just like Soma, (no sexism intended), it is more a 'chick's place' than a man's. I tried to propose there, it's that kind of place.

But if you have a sweet tooth give them a whirl. I am partial to the fruit flan and the hazelnut chocolate mousse."

Yuzu is always a good place to go, and we find ourselves heading there more nights than not. The drinks are all creative, delicious, and constantly rotating. The bartenders are friendly as well. Food is delicious as well. It's much better and more unique than your classic bar food. I absolutely love the Yuzu fries. Whatever is in the sauce on top is magical (kind of like a garlic-y horseradish-y aioli). I also really like their vegetable Ramen. The vegetables are fresh and the broth is flavorful. Definitely, check them out on a theme night or trivia night. We've gone to Parks and Rec trivia, Chardee MacDennis, and a few others, and always have a good time."

The reason I gave it two stars because we got a good deal of one large pizza (though the food sucks) and 4 one hour game cards for $40, not bad. Otherwise the place is small , food sucks, and effin kids all over the place who cut you in line because you are an adult and there for don't play games ?

Not a big fan of the industrial décor, but if the food is good I can live with it. Well - ugh!  A far cry from a burger joint, the menu was uninspired. We ordered the basic Charr burger -  one medium rare, the other medium well and got them cooked exactly the same. The garlic bun was intriguing but we both would have preferred them warmed a little. Ketchup served as the condiment of choice? I would prefer Thousand Island Dressing and maybe toss in a couple pickles. Neither of us had ever tasted Truffle fries, and I can honestly say I will never bother seeking them out. The muscle bound staff stood like guardians at the path to the restrooms. My friend braved the trail past them, announcing she had been in better restrooms in gas stations. I decided to skip the use of the facilities. I think a staff could at least ""fake"" busy so you don't feel like cattle being surveyed by prospective bidders at an auction. Charr is totally off the list of restaurants, and I wouldn't bother trying any of the sister restaurants. I can understand why people find their reservations available - it's because no one really goes there. Too many good burgers in town - I've learned to accept a $10.00 burger like I accept gasoline over $3.50 a galloon. The difference is, I have to buy gas - but I can get good food elsewhere for that $10.00.

I only wish I was in possession of one of their coupons they put out regularly. A painful experience is better with a coupon."

Our section was reserved and the food came out at the time we requested. It was very delicious too! I have lived here for some years and this was the first time I have been here.  My kids had a blast running around playing while I socialized with my co-workers. Had a great time! Thank you so much Ron for helping us to have a wonderful experience!!"

We arrive and they have given away our table because we were 10 mins late, even though I called them letting them know I will be exactly 10 minutes and they said not a problem?!?!?

So we get put at the last table at the place right by the cold window and front door :s it is a pretty small place 10-12 tables, so it was freezing there.

So we sit down and produce our voucher, which I put in my reservations with them on open table for a table of 3 people with a voucher. The server (with glasses) then proceeds to tell me they can't honor the voucher because it says 1 coupon for a table of four or 2 vouchers for tables 5 and more. I got mad at this point because that is why they have a ""note"" section on open table so you can provide extra info/requests that they are spose to look at. Wtf, he says this and then walks away as if expecting us to leave by ourselves wtf. 

No we are not incapable of paying full price but when you make your customers feel like it is their fault they didn't review their own reservations and the coupon is stupid, first time ever at any restaurant. 

So we end uP staying cuz my bestfriend's boyfriend was able to come join us *thsss lol 

So after we order our apptetizer (mussels) and entrees we wait about half an hour before our appetizer arrives, then another 45 minutes for our entrees! By the time we got our entree it was a full 1 1/2 hour after sitting down.

And while we were waiting my friend was hungry so we asked for more bread, the server came and didn't say anything and picked up the bread basket, then came back and plopped it back down! Are you kidding m?

So at this point doesn't matter how our food taste, the experience was ruined :(

Also it looks bad on me because I was the one who told my friends this place was amazing, obviously that changed!

Finally the food: caesar salad- $8 was bad in size but didn't taste it so can't comment! Mussels $7 (we ended up getting charged $9 wtf) there was 2 two bad mussels that tasted like rotten seafood! Beef dish $18 had a lot of veggies with good variety and little beef but it tasted good! The chicken ravioli came with 4 pieces and a good amount of chicken! Fair to say my guy friend was not full at all but it did taste good! I had the seafood linguine $18 which was good but also a bit salty and again one bad mussel :s for a place that has a ayce mussel nights this is pretty bad! Didn't order dessert and tipped them 12% tip and walked out knowing we would never return! Overall bad experience! :("

Waited 30 minutes after finishing the meal and never got the check. Server did not come back to refill drinks . Did not bring requested items several times . Still had to wait and the entire party got up and walked to the front of the restaurant because the manager never came out to the table. Would never eat here again or recommend it to anybody. Food was also substandard, tasted only mildly better than gas station prepared food and was far more expensive. After everything was said and done the only concession given was a 20% reduction on the check as well as a card for games in the arcade which didn't work in half the machines because the readers on the arcade games were faulty, it would take several tries to get the card to read on many of the machines if we could get it to read at all."

I love that they participate in the Pogo Pass program,  love the bowling & the bar.

I'm not so thrilled on their unlimited hour option, as the timer delays so you have to be very patient. You also don't retain any points for prizes with the unlimited option. 

On the bright side, I have seen some great deals on Groupon for GameWorks. I also like how it's a great kid-friendly atmosphere but adults can also let loose with a drink at the bar. 

I'm here somewhat often only for the kiddos, but I wouldn't mind checking other options for kid time."

They were part of their Saturday Special which included a huge pork chop a dish for which they are apparently ""known"", and 1/3 of a rack of ribs.....PLENTY of food, even if you just got done appearing on ""Naked and Afraid.""
OK, I promise no more quotation marks.
Wings are drum portion only and are fully the size of a chicken leg.
Trying them was a major reason for ordering the dish, so I could try them without committing my entire meal to their palatability.
Expertly prepared and sauced in a spicy/sweet sauce that complimented them nicely. A definite recommendation for anyone to try.
The chop was reasonably tender the marinade was decent enough, haven't gotten chops out much, but these were probably the best I've had.
The ribs were OK, but nothing for any self-respecting rib-house to fear.
The dish was served with their house sauced white beans which were a decent enough accompaniment, but not especially noteworthy.
My wife got their filet Benedict which she praised effusively.
Service was quite good, the manager usually checks in during the meal and is quite personable.
A notch above the standard sports bar, with great ambiance and plush seating."

Half of the games are out of order or in some kind of disrepair. They only had one Mario kart racing working and the steering was off! There is no tickets on that night which is fine but then half of the games are dumb because the only point of them is getting tickets.  The food and drink is over priced for what you get.

Or tossing all furniture out of the living room and getting a pool table. Still working on the first option for Mr Papagiorgio, in the mean time we made Gameworks our go to spot for playing pool. 

 Pros- kid can play glow in semi dark pool while you enjoy a Sam Adams. Only one of my kids likes pool, so our routine is to get a pool table, take advantage of the 14.99 for an entree and one hour game card special and send the more down to earth sibling out into arcade area, while we show off our non existent pool skills. 

 Everyone's happy and filled up on pizza, fish and chips, or whatever other choice kids make. Bowling alley, where pool tables are, is usually empty and mysterious, if you are looking for ambiance. Smells like feet, as God intended.
 There are also daily specials and happy hours and such for the value minded. Also, pool counts as PE, right? I homeschool, so PE credit is important. 

 Cons- pool games are far from cheap. $9/hour is making me seriously consider ditching the family poker table and investing into a nice ""I'm over my man cave"" Craig's list second hand-me-down.

 Another con is coordinating everything. We play at odd hours, so staff is light. Between hitting up one spot for pool balls, ordering food from another, juggling ID held for pool balls and ID required before Mr Sam Adams is brought out, it takes some logistical talent before everything falls into place. I learned to settle the bill upon ordering so that the ants in the pants sibling can get her hands on the game card early in the experience. 
 I just go with assumption everything will go smoothly from there and throw caution to the wind. 

 If you want to know about the food- it's frozen and fried, ok? Just like kids like it. Don't come here looking for culinary experience, shuffle over to Brio, you grown up, you. 

 In short, it's where you can take the kids when they've outgrown Chuk e Cheese, and I am OK with that."
"7WXrMVyw4W6daWeATyj3YA","Elvin","Gu-xs3NIQTj3Mj2xYoN2aw","Maxim Bakery & Restaurant","2","2010-02-07 00:00:00","Very poor service on a busy Sunday afternoon. 

Our waiter did not write down our selections and tried to keep it all in his mind. (9 people). He mixed up our orders and forgot one dish. He came back and said I have 3 dish 'a'. 2 dish 'b' etc. But as we didn't know what each other ordered, We had to talk amonsgt ourselves to find what he missed. 

A problem that could have been solved if he just wrote down our orders!!

All our meals came with a choce of soup. A choice that was denied to us. He just came out and brought some soups until someone from our group said 'so we don't get a choice?'. Only then did he say 'oh ya, you can also have the borsht if you want.'

The cream of asparagus soup was a bit thick and clearly sat out and was reheated (thick soup skin). 

Bread was cold too.   

Fettuccine bolognese was good looking; slightly oversauced. but again bad service ensued when he just shoved a fork into my plate. No 'excuse me'. Not putting it to the side. 

Another consequence of bad order taking is the wrong dishes were delivered to the wrong people.

Other mains are pork chop, beef brisket, florentine. All were average.

We had all finished and after a while we had to ask for our drinks. Another mark of poor service. No water refills at all. 

Service 0/5

The atmosphere was really chill and relax. Not only do you have a choice of table, booth but also a couch booth(which we opted for). They have fireplaces going and you're welcomed by the amazing smell of grilled foods. Also they have areas with couches and tv (perfect for you game night folks). 

The service was spectacular and our waitress Savannah was extremely attentive! She was friendly, quick and intuitive to our next need (filling up waters, condiments and etc).

Finally the food was above bar food but not gourmet quality, atleast for my plate. I ordered a bison burger medium rare and I was really disappointed by how over cooked it was. It was pretty much well done, which over all kills the natural flavor. (Pictures attached).
The deviled eggs were amazing but too salty, they sprinkle with sea salt and I would recommend going it and maybe drizzling a little syrup or honey to counter act the saltiness of the bacon in the deviled eggs.
One of us got the duck wings and he was floored by the quality of the sauce and the Sriracha ranch was INCREDIBLE! We had to ask for more of it to dip in and for myself to cover the over cooked texture of the bison. My sister loved her BBQ bacon burger and said it was amazing.

I'm giving it a 4 because I believe maybe my bison was just perhaps an off moment in the kitchen. It's obvious the skill in the cooking from the other plates at our table and the atmosphere makes it all worth the visit."

If you know me, you would likely notice my clutch word or filler word is ""interesting"". I use the word to describe situations that are different, uncomfortable or fascinating. Often, I use the word when I do not know how to respond or to fill the gap (that may otherwise be a silent void). 

Bampot House of Tea & Board Games, I would say embodies the word ""interesting"". It is truly where people from different worlds collide. It feels like a mutli-verse - one corner of the room may have people jamming with guitar, the other  corner is filled with people enjoying board games, somewhere in a hidden corner is a person quietly working hard on their project. At times, you may overhear conversations related to overcoming limiting beliefs, provoking spiritual awakening or just waves after waves of laughter.

Even the password of the wifi is contemplative - ""maybe there is more to life, maybe not"".

The food at Bampot is earnest, poignant and hearty. There is something special about a bowl of hot soup, hearty stew or sincere curry to warm you up from the inside and out on a cold day. My soup of the day, Spicy beet with chickpea soup ($7.50) was full of warmth. It was accompanied by simple toast and coconut butter. Vegetarian rejoice.All the food served at Bampot are vegetarian friendly!

There are also endless selections of teas for every flavor profile. Different tea for different peeps! My favourite at Bampot is surprisingly not tea; it is the dark hot chocolate with housemade almond milk. It was the perfect soulful drink with a hint of sweetness. The white pot and cup with silver embossed lace even matches my OOTD (outfit of the day). It must mean we are meant to be! ;) 

Sitting in a small booth alone at Bampot, surrounded by rustic cushion with a warm bowl of soup and observing life is the wonderful way to spend a quiet evening."

We had a good time on all the interactive games that were for the most part easy to understand and play for the little ones.  I do think that they could have used a few more pieces of equipment.  I understand that many of these machines cost as much as your moms Hyundai.  These machines are also very tempermental and see nothing but abuse from these super nerds who live in solitarey confinement playing Xbox 360 and only come out for cheesy gordita crucnches from Taco bell and a new Maxim magazine to masturbate to. 

 This is a tough crowd to please.  My suggestion would have been to put in a Jack In the Box for gamer dietary needs, instead of another sub par restaurant with high prices.  This is the last thing Las Vegas needed.  You could have used that huge dining space to put in more revenue..... or credit generators.

Before showing up, do a quick Google search and find yourself a deal before you show up. Groupon and even the specials on their websites have some really good deals that will give you a huge discount. For just $20 you can get an entire day of game play and a $20 game card for ticketed games if you find a discount online. It is way more expensive if you buy your ticket on site. Bring the kids here and play in the morning, come back in the evening for date night. 
The cards are really easy to lose and non replaceable so either hold on to it for young kids! 
GameWorks has a bar and quick bar food. If you come here later in the evening the average age of the crowd gets a lot older. It's located in Town Square so if you're not feeling arcade food, there are TONS of places to eat/drink outside. Park on the West side of Town Square (by the guitar shop and the movie theater)"

The menu looks great. The atmosphere is phenomenal, giving you the option to sit on a patio, at a table, on a couch, in the ""man cave,"" etc... The drink menu is great. The food, however, lacks quality. I ordered a medium rare blue cheese burger with the tater tots, based upon the suggestion of my waitress. After a pretty lengthy wait, the burger came out well-done, and served on a sub bun! It was certainly not the circular wonder-patty, I adore so much. I was willing to move past the rectangular shape of my patty and give it a shot taste-wise, but the beef was just dried out and generally awful. 

That's not to say I would never come back to the Brick House. It seems absolutely worth a try with friends for their drink menu and the atmosphere."

I liked the variety of food and drinks they offered. We had fantastic deviled eggs for an appetizer. My boyfriend got duck wings that were tossed in this DELICIOUS sauce... LAWD. UGH! I got a bacon BBQ burger which was really great! And my sister got the bison burger. She didn't like it too much... she asked for medium rare and it came out well. She is also never impressed with anyone's food but her own LOL. 

One thing they do here that I think is clutch for a good restaurant is they make their own sauces with their personal twist. They had a red pepper aoli and cilantro ranch, both of which were bomb af!

The waitress (Savannah) and other staff were super friendly and attentive!

I really want to try more of their items, so I'll be back for sure!"

The establishment is located in Town Square on the ground floor, right under the AMC Theater. There is ample parking in Town Square and the meters are used to collect donations, not to enforce parking fees, in short - your car won't get towed if you don't have change to spare. 

We arrived on a Thursday night at 615 pm. The dining area was practically empty apart from our party, party of 21. We occupied about five tables, but only three tables were ready to order when the wait-service came around. I was a little confused because we saw several servers and yet only one came by to take our orders. After he was done taking orders at one table, he went back to put the orders in, and took a while doing it too, and then came back for the next table. This went on until it was our turn to order, mind you we were the last table. 

I didn't mind that he was taking a while to get our orders but, we didn't get our water/beverages till after. I saw that he was rushing around and walking with a purpose (the dining area is kind of big). What killed me in the end was waiting for our food to come out and finally getting our check and game cards. 

I ordered the Cobb Salad which is a 1-hour Game Card item, the Classic Quesadilla with chicken for my kids to share- thats another 1-hour Game Card item, my husband had the Seared Salmon, and we had wings to share-buffalo style. Overall, the food was good. I probably wouldn't come back just to eat the food, as nothing really stood out. We were here to play games after all. 

BTW the special from Mon-Fri is that they give you 1-hour game cards when you order the game card specific items from their menu. That was a no brainer for me since my kids have too many toys at home and I didn't want them bringing more ""prizes"" home. It was about 830 pm by the time we finally checked out and received our game cards. I Checked-In on Yelp and registered/signed up for the Game Works program, so I received a coupon for a free $10 game card + 25 Bonus Points, a manager had to come around and verify my phone number in order to redeem the coupon since I didn't print it out. So of course, that took some time as well. 

1-hour of gaming is a lot of time when you are with a 6 yr old and 3 yr old. I would recommend this Mon-Friday happy hour deal to anyone who doesn't mind not being able to win tickets. Not all games are ticket. 

I did a quick restroom trip, it seemed clean enough-there is also a gender neutral restroom for families. I spied a bowling alley, a couple pool tables, a private party room, and a bar. Cool place to bring the entire family."

""The bill was $18 right? And I gave you $25?"" 

In which her response automatically was ""Oh so you weren't giving me a $5 tip?"" Which turned me off because in all honesty I didn't like her tone or the way she was looking at me. Like I was ignorant or something.

I said ""Actually it would have been a $7 tip"" 
Which wasn't a problem, I'm literally keeping track of how much cash I spend. But when you get nasty attitudes then I no longer care about how you feel or what you say. 

And before I could finish what I'm trying to say she starts going on a rant about how usually people just give her $7 if the bill is $18 and if the bill was $15 people hand her $22.. okay that's cool and all however that's not what I asked you nor did I say anything about the amount of your tip I was asking how much cash I gave you. 

Then she continues on about bartending and tips I had to interrupt her because I've bartended too, I'm also a hairstylist and never do I ASSUME people are going to tip certain amounts because sometimes they don't and I don't get upset when people ask me how much cash they gave me. I just give them the answer. 

Some of the machines are broken my fiancé swiped his card and lost points for it. 

Anyway the manager is nice however we probably won't come back here. Which sucks for me cause I like gameworks back where I'm from and wanted to come back and bring people.

Julius was so nice though!!!"

It was a nice night and we had a reservation so we were able to score a seat on the patio. Me and my husband ordered mixed drinks, a margarita and a ""Mexican sunrise"". Both were delicious, came cold and refreshing, the bar tender gave us a solid pour. We decided to order a bunch of different things just to try. We tried: the carnita tacos (3), the zucchini fritters, the chorizo corndogs, the brisket burrito, the shrimp ceviche and the chicken lollipops. There were no complaints  by anyone. Everything was very fresh, service was frequently and efficient. Dishes came out as they were ready (as indicated on the menu). The corndogs are a bit heavy, and fritters my favourite item, was a wee bit oily but nothing you can't get over. I ordered a sangria towards the middle of the meal and I didn't get it until we were almost finished. This meant I had to chug it before we could leave. It would not deter me from coming back however. The patio was quite congested, I think they have one too many chairs out there, but it's a good vibe so again no complaints. The tiki hut on the back patio is so cute, a very nice touch. Overall, a great new addition to the neighbour, any Mexican food lover will not be disappointed."

One of Maxim's most popular cakes is definitely the meringue (mango/strawberry); they are quite pricey ($32 for an 8"") but are delicious...Two of crunchy meringue (with almonds) and fresh whipped cream in between.

They offer a wide variety of choices for cakes and have always been fresh (black forest, mango mousse, cheesecake/green tea cheesecake, white chocolate  cake, mango yogurt, mocha, many more!).

The one time I had lunch here it was very quiet. The lunch specials are more pricey than your normal westernized HK cafes (ie. Firefly) as they can be up to $13-20 for a combo...although it comes with soup, main, beverage and a slice of cake. The food itself isn't bad, but my main complaint is the pathetic size of the cake of choice... it is literally 1/2 of a normal slice..honestly I don't think it would hurt to give a full slice.. you'd win people like me over who have a sweet tooth :3.

Additionally, my other complaint would be that they charge $0.50 for a small chocolate badge if you want writing on certain cakes (i.e. the meringue). The service at the cake counter can be quite lacking although there are plenty of staff chilling behind the counter.

They accept credit card for transactions over $30."

Now, that's not to say it wasn't a decent burger, but are there burger joints that do it better? You bet! Hop Doddys and Rehab Burger both in Scottsdale, I think cook a slightly better burger. That being said, why did I rate Char a 4? The service is what kicks this place up a notch. Everyone is so welcoming, including the owner who is from NY and walks the dining room asking his customers how their meal was. Oh, and the fries were pretty good too. The only downsides so far are the burgers and the hostess who walks around like she's on Xanax. I mean, come on, if you're going to hire a hostess then hire one who has a bit more pep and enthusiasm. Honestly, she looked positively bored."

The server/bartender had about a 1/2 dozen tables and serviced us all well. Multiple refills and check ins.

The food did take a while, but not too long for a real burger and there was one guy in the kitchen doing everything. I could see straight into the kitchen and saw the guy wash his hands. I appreciate his proper hygiene.

The food was very good and a good value at lunch menu prices.
One kid got the battered chicken fingers, she got a nice pile. The other kid plate came with 2 nice sized sliders and fries.

I am not a fan of truffle oil on fries and they get heavy handed with the truffle oil. Nobody else seemed to mind, just my personal taste. The sweet potato fries were good."

The new Townsquare GameWorks is none of those things. This location is an offense to the reputation they've built.

Food: 0/5. It didn't get my sick. That's the absolute best thing I can say about it. The Nachos and Pizza were far, far worse than 7/11. Yes, the pizza you get at 7/11 is leaps and bounds better than what's served at the Town Square GW. The Nachos were better in Middle School. No, I'm not exaggerating. It's edible

Service: despite half the restaurant being empty, the server informed us it would be a 20 minute wait. When I pointed out that fact that 2/3 of the restaurant was empty, she told me she was short of servers and just couldn't do it(I've worked in two high end restaurants in my life, and that is pure comedy.) There was one large party, and five other tables. I saw a minimum of five servers. There was enough staff to cover a 50 table restaurant and they made us wait so the servers wouldn't get stuck with more than a couple tables at a time. I talked to the manager who at first seemed to be shocked, then did nothing about it. The server was fairly polite but the host and manager ruined it.

Arcade: Decent. Far below the other GWs I've been to.

There's a reason there was no adult parties here alone. Only kids or parents with their kids. The service is God awful and the food is below gas station fare. The Seattle location is always packed and has more adults than kids. Take a lesson from them. 

If you've ever been to a chuckee cheese in the 90s, think of that, with way worse pizza, 5x more expensive food and gaming, and god awful service."

Their onion rings were good but that's all I can say. My son begrudgingly ate his Grilled cheese, I tried it and it was dry and lacking flavor. A tip for charrs, don't melt cheese on focaccia bread open faced then stick the pieces together and think you made grilled cheese, there's more to it than that.

We'd definitely eat-in next time though, as the restaurant decor is awesome. 

We got the Perro de Maiz (Chorizo Corn dogs), the Carnita taco, the Cangrejo de Concha Blanda taco (Soft shell crab), the Seta Picante taco (Grilled spicy mushroom), and the Cola de Langosta taco (Whole rock lobster tail). The food surpassed my expectations! The soft shell crab seemed to be a bit over-breaded, and that is probably the only one I wouldn't get again. My favourites were the Chorizo Corn dogs and the Lobster taco. 

Even though we only got take out, everyone working there was super nice and friendly when we were waiting for our food at the bar.

Usually we get their green tea or New York Cheesecakes, and you can never go wrong with them, the Cheesecakes are always delicious and never too heavy.

On our latest visit to this location, my family really wanted to the 8"" mango meringue cake but unfortunately we didn't pre order it, so the one on display had been served to customers by the piece. Thankfully, there was also a strawberry meringue that was being served by the piece too and the owner was nice enough to combine what was left of the two into one whole cake! The meringue was amazing, I don't think there's anywhere else where you can get a meringue of this quality, it was nice and fluffy as well as very flavourful. This is a great cake place!"

The former Gamewirks that was on the Strip was a wonderful attraction. It had hundreds of games in a large space as well as a rock climbing wall that was transformed into an area for more games. When the original closed in Spring 2012, it was pretty heartbreaking. There were no real arcade places around Las Vegas that was on the level of Gameworks. This new TownSquare Gameworks is a degrader. It's far more smaller which was a huge disappointment. There were a few games that were attractive such as the 3-D zombie game, basketball, football, a fighter jet simulator, a computer gaming area, and the bowling alley. Everything else was more for the younger children running around. There is also a bar for the adults to relax which is nice for them. There is a new ""Recharge Center"" to reload credit into your card which is needed for the games, which is great. Other than that I wish this place was larger and beeds more games."

I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries and everything was delicious! The burger was cooked exactly how I ordered. The meat tasted fresh and high-quality. The goodies that come with the burger (lettuce, onions, tomato, etc.) looked fresh and tasty. The fries were equally delicious. They're the thin and crispy type and not greasy at all.

Bampot's selection of board games is like it's selection of teas: vast and awesome.

They have their board games split up into sections (strategy, casual, etc.), and in your menu will come a sheet with the board games listed into sections, with the average playtime per game listed, too. Since Bampot is brand new, the board games are too! I broke open seasons to find that the game hadn't been played yet since the cards were still in their packages! No ratty old board games here!

The cover fee to play board games is $5 if you don't eat, $3 if you do.

There are, I believe, over 70 different teas you can try here. I'm not a big tea person, but I sipped some of my friends teas (apple mint, and faerie's blood), and they were both delicious (especially the faerie's blood, which is steeped with not only the tea but fresh fruit also.) Many of the teas also have free refills :)

They have a non-tea menu for people like myself, with items like Maple Milk & Hot Chocolate. I paid about $3 for not just a cup but a POT of DELICIOUS hot chocolate - some pretty great value there.

The food kicks some serious butt too. I gorged on Poutine SOUP (yep, it IS as amazing as it sounds), Chocolate Strawberry Cake (chocolatety, decadent, delicious), and a yummy yummy ""posh"" cheese board.

The staff are extremely nice, they are happy to chat, help you wade through the giant tea menu, provide both tea and board game reccomendations, and more.

The decor is also cozy and adorable. It gives off the feeling of playing board games and/or enjoying some tea in a friend's living room.

There is also shisha available, a Monday Night Craft Circle, and other events in the works.

I can't wait to come back. I will definitely be returning. What a gem!"

Sometimes the card allows you to play, but won't give you tickets. They had almost every type of game to play such as video old school arcade games,pin ball, virtual racing, air hockey, bowling, live xbox, pool table, basket ball shooting, etc...they also have a restaurant and bar. It has plenty seating. This place is good for meeting friends and having drinks. It's crowded during the weekends,but best time to go if you're an adult is Sun-Thurs after kids curfew 10pm. This allows you to play almost all the games, when it's crowded it becomes stuffy and hot, so dress lightly. Food and drinks are inexpensive, no coins are needed, you just buy a preloaded card and play as much as what you purchased. I hadn't had that much fun in years, that it left my hand and arm sore lol!

Each game was prominently displayed. There are not only big flat screens but projector tv's as well. Plus, audio for one game was playing. 

The food was typical bar food with wings, fish and chips, salads, calamari, works fries, and overloaded nachos. The portions are also fairly generous. Though there are seemingly more up scale dinners as well like steak or salmon. While I didn't try the attempts at finer food, I question the logic and quality of the ingredients of an arcade which may see someone order salmon once a week.

There's enough to keep the kids entertained so long as it's not busy. The size of the building is comparable to other chains like Dave and Buster's thanks to the bowling alley and private rooms. The designers made an oversized dining and tv watching area that doesn't fit with the number of game machines. If the dining room were packed with parents, the lines for games would be three kids deep. That is to say, there aren't enough game machines if business picks up.

As far as the bar, they do have about ten things on tap including Angry Orchard, Stella, and Sam Adams. I did find it annoying that every time is came back to the bar and the same bartender, she had to check my id. I'm a huge hipster in a hat and bright pink and blue shirt memorable enough for the bar flys to remember what team I was cheering for. I will say on behalf of a few of the girls: avoid the mixed drinks because they're poorly proportioned with too much syrup and for one mojito which was made with gin instead of rum, just wrong.

I cannot speak to the bowling or the LAN/internet gaming, but the former was empty and the later seemed packed."

From the hostess to the bartender to our waitress to Joe himself coming to chat with us, you feel like you are a regular at a restaurant that you've been going to for years. We were seated and ordered drinks, some alcoholic and some not, and all were good. The dirty Grey Goose martini was especially good. It's nice to find a place that will make it dirty when asked, instead of skimping on the olive juice. Always a plus for us is a strong, free wi-fi connection. Just ask your server for the password.

For our appetizers, our table had the tomato bisque soup, onion rings, and the red fresno pepper poppers. The soup was very creamy and thick, and the goat cheese was a great added flavor. The poppers brought some extreme heat to the table. These aren't your wimpy Sonic jalapeno poppers. The onion cream cheese filling cut the heat a bit with a nice tang, but be warned, these things pack a punch! As to the onion rings, I won't call them a ""miss"", but they were just so-so after the other two great offerings.

Various burgers were ordered along with some sandwiches. Everyone loved the obviously fresh-made garlic knot buns and fresh toppings. The sauteed crimini mushrooms and carmelized onions on my steak and blue sandwich were awesome. If you are a fan of the blue cheese, ask for extra. It was a little skimpy on my sandwich for my taste.

We were offered the desserts (made by Joe) including bread pudding and an apple crumble, but we were all too full to try those. Definitely next time."

The bar area and dining room were dimly lit and to our surprise almost empty. We were told to take a seat. We sat and waited for our server until I believed to have been forgotten. We flagged a waitress down. She took our drink orders and sent our server to our table. Our drinks arrived 10 mins later. The mint was fresh in my Mojito however the limes in both our drinks were discolored and unpleasant looking.  A waitress came over beside our table and started polishing dinnerware and talking on her cell phone in a very loud manner. I wished she would have chosen a different table away from us to do this task as there were many others to chose from.  Our burgers arrived with a side of thin cut, crispy fries and burger fixins. We topped our burgers with the veggies only to realize that the chipotle mayo was missing. Our server apologized and bought us the condiment.  My husband and I each had a hard time eating our burgers. The kaiser roll they came on was just too tough for our liking.  With eat bite we took the inside of our burgers would push out into our hands. I ended up dumping my burger contents on my plate and just eating the patty. The patty itself tasted charred and was a very nice quality beef. They were cooked to our liking. The experience in this restaurant was okay, far from the worst and far from the best. Pretty much just a 'meh' experience."

I recently attended one, where the family rented out a large room that had plenty of space for guests and tables full of pizza, wings, Philly cheesesteak egg rolls, and bruchetta. The food wasn't anything special, but that's to be expected from a place that focuses on games and entertainment. The employees working the party were friendly and attentive, regularly making sure food and drinks were restocked. The kids at the party were given cards that entitled them to 2 hours of game play on almost all games. Even on a Friday night there were plenty of games available with little to no wait times."

On to the games:

I still however love the environment. It reminds me more of a ""Dave and Buster's"" establishment with a bar and restaurant available right inside. You're able to reserve for parties which makes it perfect for groups and birthdays. If you're a hard core gamer this might not be the arcade for you since the selection of games is limited. But if your just here for fun family and games it'll be experience for you and whomever you want to bring. 

Service is really top notch as always.
So make sure to enjoy your time here : )

My review is more for the arcade portion of this establishment.

everything else gets a 4 star rating."

Asked for their namesake sake/nihonshu but they were all out of it.

Was excited to try some newly introduced Cleveland-area ramen, but the Herbivore ""ramen"" was a horrifying $7 joke of a meal. A clump of something-noodles in a cereal bowl of pure Kikkoman soy sauce and 5 chunks of assorted mixed vegetables? Who are you kidding, Yuzu?  Really the only palatable item in the swirling salty miasma of darkness was the soft boiled egg. One star for the really pleasant and attentive server and creative drink menu."

The facility itself is HUGE! There are tons and tons of games to play, my favorite was the frog log jump and the Terminator one!! They also have ski ball and a basket ball shooting game. For those of you faithful gamers they even have an entire room set up for online/computer games where you can play til your hearts content while sipping cocktails. My favorite part is their full bowling lanes!! 

When you're ready to wet your whistle they also have a large full bar with a full menu. My visit happened to be their second day of being open, so their food was still needing some tweaking, however everything I ate did have great flavor. I am definitely looking forward to giving their menu another try."

1. Space too small
2. Too much empty space in the front area so it seems like
    they're still decorating or ran out of money
3. When you get a time play card, they fail to
    tell you:
    a. Can't collect the tickets from games
    b. Can't play the ""win a prize"" games
    c. Have to wait 1 minute in between swipes before you
        can play a new game or add another person's turn -
        therefore, your ACTUAL play time drops to 30
        minutes

The food looks amazing - but doesn't taste as promising as it looks. Some food items can get pricey.

The eSports room was the area most enjoyed by my family.

The selection of games is very poor. They had several riding/driving games. And they were the standard run of the mill fast and the furious type. There was one that the steering wheel was stuck and we couldn't play it because we couldn't steer. Wasted money on that one. The other ones we played the steering was too loose and you ended up all over the place but not on the course. 

The only race game worth it was Mario Kart. 

There was three fighting games. Tekken was good as always. Marvel vs Capcom machine was shot. The screen was messed up and couldn't be played. Didn't even get to play. Street Fighters joysticks were busted and couldn't be used to do anything but random forward and back. 

Pinball machines were meh. Ghostbusters was the highlight here. The Game of Thrones one was missing it's glass panel where the artwork goes. 

The hunting shooting games didn't seem calibrated. Also we inserted our cards in the cabella big game hunt game and the system rebooted and we lost our credits. Just walked away from that one.

The corn was excellent, their version of elotes. Definitely a must try. The zucchini tacos were yummy as it was crispy and has a good amount of salsa. The fried avocado was ok, was not a huge fan and was one small avocado for the price of $9. The prices were okay, but portion sizes were small. The chula beer was excellent and another must try.

They clearly view the place as a community-building hub. A couple of the staff are inconsistent and bring the cafe down, but please give Bampot another chance, if you happened to fall upon an aloof or surly employee.

We both love tea and board games so it was the perfect combination. We went to check it out a couple of weeks after it opened. 

The environment of the cafe definitely suits the name. The cafe is decorated with yellow, orange, and dark red walls, reminding me of the Indian culture. There are some areas where you can sit in the nooks and crannies of the cafe with only pillows and drapes, giving off that bohemian vibe. The space gives a lot of intimacy compared to most places I have been to; which is nice and unique to Bampot. 

Bampot serves a vast selection of tea, some with free refills. Like most places, it has a $5 sitting fee if you would like to play the board games. However, it only costs $3 if you decide to order food. My boyfriend got the soup of the day, which was some sort of Thai curry soup the owners whipped up. He absolutely loved it and I enjoyed it as well. It had that spicy flavour that curry lovers would be familiar with. I had the Quangzhou Milk Oolong tea, which tasted exactly what you would expect a milk tea would taste like. It wasn't my favourite, but I didn't mind drinking it either. For each pot of tea you receive, you get a timer as well, so you know when the tea is perfectly steeped. Between my boyfriend and I, we pretty much drained all the hot water they had for our free refills haha.

There are currently about 160 games available and when I was there, many of them were unopened. My boyfriend was in heaven for a short period of time after I found a brand new Firefly board game towards the end of our stay. Unfortunately it was a two hour game and we were already there for about two to three hours. He sadly had to wave goodbye to it.

The cafe hosts different events here and now. They have Scrabble Night on Mondays and free knitting lessons often. They planned on having a Dungeons and Dragons game night as well. The owners said that they were looking for games to host events for. If you are a game enthusiast and would like to bring an event to Bampot, definitely reach out to them!

Overall, I highly recommend Bampot. It's so good that it's now my boyfriend's favourite board game place, knocking Snakes and Lattes to his second favourite. This is definitely a great date location to spend with your significant other. Also if you are a tea enthusiast, it is a must to visit! The cafe is very intimate and cozy with such a lovely staff. I don't recommend coming in with a large group of friends unless you are willing to break the group down. It's best to have no more than three (or at most four) other friends with you because of the space. The cafe also has hookah available as well."

Needless to say, there's something here for everyone, including even gaming consoles!

If you're there over mealtime, there's also a bar and a full-service restaurant within the facility.  We didn't partake at the bar, so I'll leave that for others to review.  The food was average at best, and the although the hostess and waitstaff were friendly, it was very clear that none of them were enthusiastic about being there.  Even with a lot of open tables, it took over 30 minutes to seat our party, and when they did, the tables were cleared but still dirty.  It appeared everyone wanted to be working somewhere else, or not at all.  This strikes me as odd since GameWorks is located in Town Square and is essentially surrounded by other dining options.  With average food and below average staff, and access to a big variety of food within just a few minutes walking distance, it seems GameWorks might want to stick to its primary purpose and make better use of the space by putting in a small snack bar, and using the rest of the floor space for more games.

I'll definitely go back with my son to play more games, but we won't eat there again.  No point paying the price for decent food but being served mediocre food when there are so many other options right there.  So go to game, not to eat."

The Phoenix burger was in serious need of seasoning, as were the sweet potato fries. My husband tried the Cuban and while the garlic aioli was good (if you love garlic like I do), it was overpowering and the only thing you could taste.
Bar had no happy hour options and we were told it was because they hadn't put one together yet? Sorry excuse for spendy drinks, I think.
Overall a very pricey dinner excursion for a mediocre meal."

The waiter was friendly but somewhat unattentive and tried to push the other restaurants/deli on to us quite a bit. The food was pretty mediocre but edible..no complaints. I'm not a huge string fry fan so I was hoping for some thicker cut ""chips"". The blueberry bread pudding was okay. It tasted like they used old garlic bread from the other restaurant next door then smothered it in whiskey and butter. We went about 15-20 minutes without a water refill and waited 10 minutes for our card to be picked up. All in all it was just okay but at least now we know and it only cost us $30.

A large and very strong cocktail, the Charrismo (their take on a cosmopolitan). Quite good. Appetizers, I had crab cakes, GF had wings after asking to make sure they weren't too spicy. They were about a 5 on a scale of 10 spiciness, too much for her. Waitress offered to exchange 'em, but we simply swapped. I thought they were great. Fries with orders, I had salmon burger (great), GF had Portobello Burger (phenomenal). I had a beer flight, she had a glass of Chardonnay. Then we still had desserts, but were full so we'll get to those tonight. Really a great deal for 30 bucks per.

"DrnGZrzdxxsUys2cUSYGBQ","Gaby","1WBkAuQg81kokZIPMpn9Zg","Charr An American Burger Bar","3","2013-09-09 00:00:00","It was okay... First off, this place is in a strip mall - not the kind of place you expect to be asked ""do you have reservations?"" I think there is a little mismatch here. The decor is smart and clean, if a little bland. It screams ""American Bistro"" in a cookie-cutter manner. The good things? They have a raw bar and do oyster shots (which I found reasonably priced, too)! Their bar is denfinitely well-stocked and they have a select list of wines and local/ micro-brew beers and ales (San Tan Ale was my choice that evening and it didn't disappoint), the shots were served cold (Patron) with lime, but no one remembered the salt until it was requested (quibble if you will, but I do like salt and lime with most commercial tequila). The quality of the ingredients of the food is quite good, too. Now the bad part: It took over 35 minutes for my order to come out (a burger and fries, an oyseter shot) and when one of the people at the table asked for HER check (not ""the check""), we got everyone's tab on it! WHat a nightmare. The server, who had been inattentive or disorganized all night never got better (hint: you will improve your tips if you don't call the men ""buddy"" and ""bro"" and if you don't call the women ""sweetie."" Frankly, ""Sir"" and ""Ma'am"" work really well). And the burger was NOT rare, but to be fair, you really can't get a patty that thin to be rare and warm. Oh, and ""truffle fries?"" Meh. Truffle oil doesn't impress me, but the texture was right, not overcooked or undercooked with a nice crisp outside. The beef was tasty, but the patty surprisingly thin, even for a $10.00 burger.
I'll go back, but I won't be in any hurry if I do and I'll ask for a different waitstaff if I get the same waiter. All in all, it seems like some of the staff could use a little more training in cadence and attentiveness but the food was pretty good.
Oh, and lastly, the bathrooms in a place that is trying to be upscale should be in good repair - broken tp holders and a large unpainted patch job isn't consistent with the image this restaurant wants to project."

Prices here are outrageous. Burger, fries and a drink is about $18. I'm not exaggerating prices either. My wife ordered the 5 cheese sandwich and it was bad. Just a huge blob of cheese on some bread. Extremely flavorless cheese log. I will not be back to this place and really want my $40 back. 

If you notice, the only good reviews on this restaurant all refer to the owner Joe so these are all his friends and of course they are going to give a 5 star review.

Heed my advice and go somewhere else. $6 for a side of fries!!!! I still can't believe this."

However, there were a large number of machines that were out of order. Especially a lot of the driving games with 2 player options had 1 player not working.  I feel like the maintenance of their machines used to be a lot better, or maybe the machines are just getting old and they are due for new ones.

Of those things, they hit 2/3. Board games were a ton of fun and the selection was great. We spent about 5.5 hours there and actually made it within 15 minutes of closing at about 1:30am. The tea selection is also pretty extensive; some of the teas are also hand blended/mixed in-house and may take a bit longer to prepare. I had the Bazaar blend (hand mixed) and it was excellent. The right balance of a strong black tea with a unique mixture of spices including saffron that brought a nice twist. 

The downsides now. While the tea was good, the snacks were just okay. And we tried quite a few of them. Vegetarian curry, peppermint chocolate cake, boterkoek, hummus and salad and bowl of bits and bites (kind of like a trail mix). None of those were great and worth ordering again in my eyes. But it's good to have some snacks while indulging in the tea and games. 

Another downside was the service - VE-RY SLOW. It's a good thing the board games kept us distracted. Other than that, the seating is comfy and cafe is very Bohemian inspired. I thought it was a nice surprise to find out some of the art work on display can be purchased.

Overall, would recommend Bampot for a fun night of board games and great tea!"

We ordered the Family Dinner to go from Aiello's Salumeria just down the sidewalk, and ate here while waiting for our food. 

Bryan had the green chili burger while I had the pizza burger. We decided to order different ones so we could split and try both. The buns are actually garlic knots or something similar, but they are shaped like cinnabons in which the dough is spiraled all the way to the center. Unique fun idea but man, does this make for a horribly messy burger. You are forced to gobble up the burgers very quickly so they don't fall apart on you. The pizza burger was good, but I liked the chili one more just because there was more flavor to it. It's not that spicy either, so if you're afraid of spice, you are safe to order this chili one. 

The restaurant and bar are very nice. I loved the dark woods and back lighting. The place is alot more trendy and fun in comparison to the rustic, yet charming older restaurant on Central Avenue close to Camelback. I'm hoping for this place to be a success, but I feel like there are a few more ""things"" that need to be worked out. Even if their burgers are just okay to most people it seems (after reading several previous reviews), let me assure you that their regular Italian food is their specialty and what they're amazing at!"

I'm surprised to read that some people were less enthused by their food.  It wasn't the best tacos I've ever head, but it was definitely above average, and I basically didn't have any complaints with the food.

The place was busy, noisy (because it was busy), there were a few mixups with the order and a server dropped a tray of drinks nearby, so it was a bit too chaotic. I hope that it will calm down a little and that the food consistency will settle in (since my food was great, and other people seem less enthused), and everyone will agree this is a nice place to go for drinks and food.

Give it a bit of time to find its rhythm, then give it a try."

I could easily end the review here and feel like I covered the very basic gist of what this place is all about, but allow me to get a bit more in-depth-- starting with a very short background story. 

GameWorks is no stranger to Sin City, having held open a Strip-side location that saw early success, but ultimately couldn't make ends meet. After a substantial hiatus, they once again returned, this time making their home in Town Square. 

After enjoying this location since its opening, I can safely say this was mutually a good decision on their part-- for myself and their business. Traffic rarely wanes during the summer, even on weekdays. The location itself is more suited for locals since parking is easier to come by than the Strip location, and traffic is far less of an issue. The single-level design of the arcade might be a point of contention for quite a few who knew the old GameWorks, but I find it a lot easier to navigate.

The games themselves are decently maintained, not to the scope that certain Round 1s I've been to are, but enough that on any given day that few machines, if any, will ever be out of service during operating hours.

The staff are generally attentive to most needs in my experience, but things of that nature are VERY different between person to person and your mileage will vary.

Prices for menu and bar items are about what you'd expect. The menu has improved quite a bit over time, but the options wouldn't be enough to entice the truly picky from other offerings within walking distance. It's bar food for casual bites, not a Zagat-rated establishment.

The hidden jewel of this place, however, is not the bowling alley, restaurant area, Dark Ride or the redemption counter-- it lies within the E-Sports center. Rows of consoles and gaming PCs await to satisfy the needs of more at-home gamers, with frequent community events for certain games to give the place a sense of being a hub for all that's happening in the world of competitive gaming. Of all the areas in this arcade, this one has always felt the most welcoming too.

All that, and you can order food and alcohol in the E-Sports area (provided you are of legal age).
Imagine all of the drunk Mario Kart games you could have with your friends...

All in all, GameWorks has become a bit of a cornerstone in the gaming scene here, and it's not going anywhere. With its central location, great entertainment options and cozy E-Sports center, it's well-suited for players of all levels, casual and competitive."

Did the 2 hour special on card with one entree (pizza) for $23 bucks. Not bad, considering I let the kids share the card instead of buying them there own card with limited amount of credits; which in my opinion is more expensive. Food wasnt amazing but wasnt terrible either. Had a lot of cool stuff like a separate bowling alley and a separate video game console area to play pc/video games - that however isnt part of the gaming card deal and you have to pay $5 per person per hour FYI. Someone gave us their all day pass because they were leaving so the kids got to play longer. We did leave and did the pay it forward thing to and gave the card to someone else to utitlize as well. Would love to see more old school arcade games as well as more games in general. Typical arcade games that could be found at Dave n Busters, Chuck E Cheese, etc."

It is an upscale casual bistro that happens to be run by Chinese.  And with this arrangement, Maxim offers exceptional value when compared to other casual fine dining establishments.  

Upon entry, I noticed the dim lighting, the white clothed tables, the pleasant and tasteful decoration and, you can't miss it, a wide selection of cakes in a refrigerated display case.

We ordered from the set dinner menu a Pickled Pork Hock with Sauerkraut and Potato ($19) and a Maxim's Mixed Grills ($22). Both came with roll and butter, starter soup, a piece of cake of your choice and a hot beverage. The Pork Hock was well portioned.  It was the size of a baseball (see pic). The flavour was bold, though not as complicated as the authentic pork hock at The Muskets. The meat was very juicy. The flavour was unfortunately one dimensional, but the tenderness and the juiciness of the meat made up for it. The Mixed Grills had a mix of steak, pork, sausage, and lamp chops (see pic). My BF said they chops were all tender and flavourful, though maybe salty for some. The cut of the meat was good.

I eagerly awaited the dessert because the cakes looked so pretty in the refrigerated display case.  There were maybe 10 types to choose from.  Patrons were expected to choose by viewing the case and ordered it through a wait staff back at table.  My BF chose a slice of Cappuccino Meringue and I chose a slice of Blueberry Almond Meringue.  I must say the Cappuccino Meringue was the better of the two.  

Is Maxim good? Yes, food tastes decent.  Is Maxim a good deal?  Oh 200% yes, if you order from the set menu.  The regular menu is rather pricey.  Is Maxim French?  I am not sure.  It tastes more continental to me.  The service was efficient and sufficient, yet definitely not refine by the standard of a casual fine dining restaurant.

Maxim is a solid choice if I feel like enjoying a Western meal in class but don't want to hurt my wallet too much."

Then we moved over to play the football throwing game and they only had 2 machines. 1 of them didn't work. It started getting irritating.

GOOD NEWS: burgers now come with side of  fries for the same price. 

BAD NEWS: The service was horrible. We just ordered burgers. I had the Carolina (with bbq sauce ON THE SIDE) he ordered the Phoenix burger. In only a few minutes our food was brought out by a someone from the kitchen. They asked, ""who had the Carolina?"" and set the plate in front of me when I responded and then gave the other burger to my father. 

My burger had BBQ on it (not on the side as I ordered) had it came on the side I would not have touched it. My fathers burger was just a plain cheese burger. We figured that we got someone else' order as it came out so fast. My father told the waitress about his lack of ""Phoenix"" in his burger and she went to the kitchen before I could get to my BBQ sauce issue or our theory of it being for a different table. Someone came from the kitchen and took the ""Phoenix"" burger away and came back 20-30 seconds later with roasted pepper on it and left. We got the waitress again to say that it still didn't have the chipotle mayo and she left immediately to get some despite me trying to tell her about the bbq burger I did not want. 

We told the waitress when she came back with the mayo that my burger had bbq on it and not on the side, but rather than having them recook my burger (they took my burger away but left my father to eat his) we just abandoned the meal. Also we never got flatware and/or napkins the entire time. 

Overall we spent 3 or 4 times longer trying to get our servers attention and get the order fixed (not including time it would take to fix mine had we stayed) than it took to get the food after we ordered. 

We are not picky eaters nor complainers. But they failed to do accommodate our one simple request (no bbq) and also simply forgot two components (the only two things that make it a ""Phoenix"" burger rather than a cheese burger) on another and made it a circus trying to fix them rather than just simply scrap the two burgers and remake them again correctly. 

The whole experience made me think that they just did not give a s**t. Little to no effort by the waitress and how can a kitchen claim they make great burgers if their solution to missing components it just to add them several minutes after they serve the food."

It was was better than the gameworks that use to be on the strip near the mgm. This one is cleaner, it seems bigger or maybe its just their set up is better but its really nice. They have a video game room with up to date video gsme consoles and computers. Very cool cause its like a kids lounge area where they can chill and play video games on couches and or sit at a computer at a desk and chair and play games on there. Also they have a small bowling alley. It was small but for the price it was pretty neat. Only a few dollars per game and shoes. All the games were fun. My daughter really enjoyed the ski ball the most. Some of the games that were more credits than the others was a little bit of s rip off and the way they kept track of your tickets made me wonder because its all on a card and my daughter played for a good hour and only ened up with a small amount of tickets so made me wonder how they track how many ticketd you get per game. But the fact my daughter was having fun made me not even car. She got about 500 tickets for the entired 3 hrs we were there. She got to get 3 small toys at the prize area. The lady said she was 20 tickets over with the one prize she picked out but she just let my dsughter have the small little cup she wanted. So that was very nice customer service.  I mean you figured if im spending $30-$50 for my 6 yr old to play games there the fact they let her walk with one small free gift shouldnt be a big deal since i spent more money on the games than the toys. Lol. The toy is worth less. I guess you're just pretty much paying foe the experience not the toys. Thats a better way of saying it. I will for sure go bsck again sometime.  She liked it and I like that she liked it. I like that its right there in town square too. What a nice location. Convenient and also smart because they probably get a lot of teenagers and or kids cause its right near the movie theater and town square is pretty busy most of the time."

The service at dinner was great.  The server acknowledged they had only been open for about three weeks, and they were continuing to take any feedback to improve the experience.  

The shareable crab cake was delicious, but the portion needs to be shipped off!  If you get it,  don't feel ashamed to be a bit greedy as the $14 cake is just that, one expensive cake!  HOWEVER,  the chicken nachos!  You can't go wrong!  

 The entrees were interesting.  I got the beef rib dish.  It's not something usual for me, but I took the server's advice (he was a good guy).  I found the meat to be a bit fatty.  I found enough tasty pieces to satisfy...  The most unsettling part of the dish was the way the meal was garnished.  Imagine the sword in the stone...  But it was the rib-bone jammed into the pile of wasabi mashed potatoes.  Different.

The beer selection was ok...  Just too expensive (I understand the place is on the strip).  I think I could have walked across the way to a competing place, and it would have been more affordable.

The game variety was fun (I stink at video games) ,and I enjoyed pinball.  The pacman air hockey will either make you pull a muscle or lose an eye!  It is not to be missed!  

After speaking to a few staff members, it's clear they are working to adjust things.  I'll give them a few weeks and will try them again.  

Be patient!  I think the place will compete for your attention soon!  Huge TV and video walls will be sure have your favorite sports games available. 

Oh yeah, there is bowling and computer games there too (not sure what those are all about)."

Today, however, was a whole new level of terrible.

After a few hours of work, I stopped on my way home to grab a late lunch and catch some of the game. The place didn't seem too busy. Plenty of seats on the floor and maybe 6 people at the bar.

As I walked in, 2 hostesses were waiting by the door having a conversation amongst themselves and 1-2 other staff members. 

After a few minutes of standing there...neither addressed me. I shrugged it off and sat myself at one of the 4 sides of the bar in front of one of tv's that had the game I wanted to watch. I had an entire side of the bar to myself. 

A few minutes later, a bartender took my order: a cup of coffee and a breakfast plate with eggs over easy, hash-browns, bacon, and a waffle. Shortly after, when I looked up, I noticed that the channel had been changed to a different game. I waited for her to return to ask if it could be changed back. In the mean time, a cup of coffee was placed in front of me by another person who quickly walked away before I could ask for anything. The tv remained untouched...

I sat and drank the coffee and squinted at another tv across the bar to try to catch some of the game...Finished the coffee and waited a few more minutes before yet another person stopped to ask if I needed anything...I replied ""yes"" and asked about the TV and if I could get another cup of coffee. Her reply was simply, ""sure"". She then quickly turned around and walked away. 

25 minutes later (now well over 45 minutes since I sat down) the person I placed the order with arrives to tell me that my order was mixed up and would be out shortly. She apologized and said that the meal would be no charge. I thanked her and asked for a refill on the coffee...

A few minutes more and another cup of coffee finally shows up. 

Another 15-20 minutes will go by before the ""chef"" personally delivers my order. 

The ""chef"" apologized, said that they were very busy and that there was a mix up and that it meal would be ""on him."" He placed the plate of food on the bar in front of me and quickly turned away to converse with some of what I assumed were his personal friends that had just sat a few seats down from where I was...they asked him if the game that they wanted to watch could be switched to the same tv I attempted to watch earlier. He said, ""of course!"" And, magically, the channel changed almost immediately to the game that his friends asked about.

Meanwhile, as I stare at my plate, I began to ponder over what exactly in the fuck I was looking at. I recalled that nearly an hour earlier, I had ordered a breakfast plate with eggs over easy, hash-browns, bacon, and a waffle. However, what I was looking at seemed to be brownish/black eggs over burnt to a crisp over french fries,(not hash browns), cold to the touch bacon, and waffles (the waffles looked fine)...no syrup...actually, no one asked if I wanted any condiments at all...nor any ice water...or anything else.

I pushed the plate away and again waited a few minutes for anyone to approach so that I may address the issue(s).

After a few minutes more, I placed a single dollar down on the bar, stepped down, put on my coat and left...completely unnoticed.

I will conclude with my final review:

IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS PLACE IS A GIANT STEAMING PILE OF BULLSHIT.

Thank you to the hostesses for not breaking away from your group discussion to seat me.

Thank you to the bartender(s) for taking my order In whatever timely manner accommodates your personal needs. 
Really, the coffee was fantastic...especially, when it's 30-40 minutes between top-off. 
Also, things like water and condiments would have been nice. But, I totally understand, you probably were just too busy...

And, thank you ""chef"" for personally delivering this visible plate of shit to my seat at the bar....for explaining away all the my time that you wasted by being too busy and too confused...And offering to personally pick up the tab...then immediately turning your back to take time out of your busy, confusing work day to converse to no end with your personal friends a few seats down.

I never walk into a restaurant  expecting anything for free.

What I expect is a shortlist of very basic criteria:

Reasonably polite and swift service.
And, that the food to arrive in a timely manner, well prepared, and as closely made to the way I might have ordered it. 

Today, none of this very basic criteria were even closely met.

Your pitiful explanations and pitiful offer to pick up the bill is NOT what I expected nor does it make up for your absolute incompetence In nearly every way (I mean the waffle didn't look too fucked up).

I wish you the best of luck and that we may never cross paths again.

Sincerely,
One less person for you to push your terrible service and terribly prepared food upon.

Update: still shitty"

The first thing that I noticed when I sat down was the floor was wet. I figured they had just mopped, boy was I wrong! As I was sitting there during my meal a drip of water caught my eye. I looked up and the duct work was leaking! There was water all over the exposed duct work in the ceiling and it was leaking on floor! Gross imagine if that landed in my food or on me. 

Now about the food. First it was way over priced. Each item is sold separately. I looked at the drink menu and almost fell over. A cocktail is on average $8. I ordered the 5 cheese melt (sounds yummy right? WRONG) When the sandwich came to the table it looked horrible! Just a large mound of cheese on tiny bread. When I opened the sandwich the inner layers of cheese weren't even melted. I took a bite (thinking it was going to clog my arteries the whole time) and it didn't even have any flavor! A grilled cheese I make at home tastes better. I didn't even finish a half of a half and the waitress never even acknowledge that I didn't even touch my meal. 

I will never go here again. Moral of the story... overpriced, gross food and who knows whats dropping into the food as it's being walked around the room."

The hostess never offered inside or outside seating. 
Walking outside we noticed the many dirty tables, and the trash from previous customers littering the floor. In addition to the dirty tables, there was broken glass lying on top. The glass came from the lightbulbs above. So we moved inside. 
Once inside  we were seated near a server station where you could hear the servers and hostess cursing. In addition to the foul language I witnessed a sever chasing the hostess around the restaurant with a dead bug! 
I had ordered a beer on draft which was poured into a warm glass so with in minutes the beer was room temp and unpleasant. We both had burgers of course. I had ordered mine med rare and my girlfriend had ordered hers med well,both came out over and under cooked.

I used to be this place's biggest fan, always raving about it my friends (and even strangers!) but today I was really disappointed and I don't think I'll be going again.

A friend and I came in today and we were surprised by a giant hanging shoe rack-- while fine in theory, people's feet smell, and having several stacked up right by the door was not a great idea considering the place is already narrow. I also noticed that there was a significant lack of lighting, and artwork.

We weren't even given any menus, but were told to grab a couple ourselves from a basket. That was really strange since normally you're given one as soon as you're seated, but I was willing to look past it. The new menus are very hard to go through, so I stuck to the old menu that's been around for years, and picked out a tea. One of the employees suggested something else, and after we agreed to try it, he went off to the back and sang while he made us our tea. It took him a long time to get back to us, passing back and forth while chatting to others, letting us know that he'd be ""several minutes."" We didn't get our order taken til 15 minutes after sitting down, but we did get our tea quickly once he had a minute. The weird thing is, though, that one of the owners was there, and he was just lounging around.

The tables were sticky, but the employee who sat us down ran off to grab some napkins to clean up. After we got our drinks, we felt like we were unwelcome. The owner didn't even acknowledge us but literally took the time to greet everyone else who walked in. We were also ignored for the entire time we were there, so we ended up deciding to cut our visit short and just pay for the one pot of tea. We left without anyone acknowledging us (after paying), and both my friend and I felt really uncomfortable and like people were being hostile towards us.

We did notice the demographic changed a lot from when we would go in-- there didn't actually seem to be very many people in, but the people who were in were performers for the event happening later on that evening. I always went to Bampot for the atmosphere and the people, but now it seems like those have deteriorated as well. The food was never that great (though I've always loved their sahleb), the service is dangerously close to bad, there seems to be a newly developed hostility to people who don't fit the Bampot ""type,"" and the new seating is really uncomfortable and cramped in the back. The tea is very good, and it always has been, but it wouldn't be hard to find another place to pop in to.

I really hope they get their shit together, I loved this place in the past and it's just so sad seeing what it's become now."

Pros. A couple decent games. My son is 6 so he was impressed! Lol staff was nice and helpful. Well ventilated for all the people inside. 


Overall it needs work, needs more floor games, still something to take the kids to do in this town you cant beat that . If it gets better I'll def come back"

We had my sons birthday here today. I would HIGHLY recommend Gameworks as the venue for your next party. While I agree with other reviewers that the food leaves a great deal of room the improvement the party packages and service more than make up for it.

We had the Carolina BBQ Burger on a garlic knot instead of regular bun, which is a genius idea, and the truffle fries. We finished our meals with the apple crumb cobbler. Everything was amazing.

I have to say after reading what everyone else has said. I can't say I disagree. I had high hopes for the food. It fell short on flavour.  We didn't even finish our ceviche which  I always do because  it's a go to fave for me.

We were seated in the second floor dining area. Same level as the patio so I had to check it out. It looks amazing. Maybe in the summer. 

The service was sporadic. Present in the beginning but absent after the food was served. We waited forever for someone to come by to the point where we just flagged down another server to get our bill.

It's not a bad spot. It just had no standouts in terms of food. we ordered a variety of tacos to share too. The drinks - cocktails and beer - were okay. I'd say if they bumped up their food flavour game and worked a bit more on customer service this would be a solid spot. 

It has a ton of potential. The interior design is incredibly inviting so I'm crossing my fingers."

The restaurant is really cool and appealing to the eye. The food is really really good. I have had the buffalo chicken sandwich and on this trip I had the Carolina burger. The fresh handmade garlic bun is an awesome addition to any burger. I have zero complaints as far as food goes.  Food gets 4 stars. 

My issue with this place is the service, or lack there of. Upon arrival there were two other tables that were occupied. It still took 10 minutes to get a drink. 15-20 minutes after that we got to order food. The food arrived after a reasonable amount of time. I felt like I wanted to pay my bill at that time so we could leave in a timely manner and not be held bill captive.  Service gets 2 stars. 

I want this place to survive because it is a local business with great food. Service issue needs to be resolved to reflect the price point of food. There are a million places to go get a $12.00 entree and a $5.00 beer, give me a reason to want to spend my money here."

I've yet to try their Baklava. Their vegan cheesecake is superb. However, you don't go to Bampot to eat. You go there to enjoy one of their myriad of teas.

TEAS: Bampot offers some of the best selection of teas in the GTA IMHO. My all-time favourite is the Desi Chai (Indian Masala Chai). It's creamy and flavourful. A pot for one person was enough for 3-4 cups. I was impressed. Whatever kind of tea you like, you will find it at Bampot.

SERVICE: The service was courteous and friendly. Your waiter will be happy to advise you on the best tea according to your preferences.

AMBIANCE: This place is not your typical cosmopolitan, hipster-ish tea house. It feels more hippy-ish, more relaxed, more communal, than commercial. It's a gathering spot for all kinds of people who come to Bampot to have a good time. Bampot is not for those seeking the next ""hot"" coffee / tea house in the neighbourhood. It's for those who want to enjoy a cup of good tea and have a relaxed conversation with their friend or partner.

I know I'll be back at Bampot soon for another teapot of Desi Chai."

The game selection is small like many reviewers already stated, but the games they do have work well. They even have a Pump It Up Infinity that works amazingly well. I would like to see more Japanese games out here like Beatmania and Pop n' Music since the Gemini arcade palace closed.

Anyway..in my opinion the food is overpriced but decent.  Not gourmet, but decent.  The best thing on the menu is the Yardbird chicken sandwich with tater tots.  Very Good!

I do like the atmosphere, patio is nice, as are the fireplaces.  Nice place to take a date.  But the seats at the bar are so worn and rickety, you are constantly wondering when they are going to collapse and make you look like a fool in front of the cute staff!

They have games for tickets which can be traded in for prizes in the end as well as a room full of computer/video games. Games for everyone! 

They have a few pretty good deals for games only but the one we took advantage of was the unlimited play for an hour with an entree. 

There was some miscommunication between how to purchase the deal and we got sent around to 3 different people so that was a bit frustrating. Only other downfall was the service in the restaurant. We waited for almost 10 minutes before anyone came and greeted us or got our drinks, then another 30 minutes for our food. I'm not a master chef but I don't think our nachos, cheese pizza and burger takes that long to prepare. Also, our server was less than attentive.

With these buns we noticed that they are a much hardier type of bun that won't become soggy after sitting as easily. Sturdy yet soft. Butter lettuce, tomato, and onion served on the side.

We went in last night and were seated immediately. The server was really friendly, quick and professional. We wanted to try a few things, so we ended up with some fried cod tacos, tortillas and guac and the chorizo corndogs. 

Everything was frankly way better than I expected (remember that aforementioned skepticism?). The guac was fresh, chunky and really dynamic, not to mention clearly made in house. The accompanying chips were tasty and grease free, which was nice. The fish tacos were really good, a bit busier than I usually like. I found the fish to be slightly overcooked; but seeing as I tend to prefer my proteins slightly under I assume this is me being picky, and not an actual reflection of the kitchen. But the best thing was the chorizo corn dog. I'm almost tempted to go back tonight and get another one! We even got the churro sundae and it was delicious! But I'm glad I shared; it was very sweet and rich!

The room was nice, the bar was cool and the mural was really pretty. The only thing that underwhelmed was the bathroom -waaay too small and cramped! But if that's the worst thing I can say, there's really no complaints."

This location used to be a local pub that kind of lost its way, now Chula moved in. The food is good, I had the pork, rice, corn and bean dish. My partner had beef brisket burrito.  His dish was good, he loved it, mine na not so much, it was hearty but missing something and I think it was sour cream. They may want to offer that as a side or add it entirely. We also had drinks, I had 2 beer and my partner had a beer and a mojito. When we received the bill we were a bit taken back, $67.00  before tip. Considering the portion size and two drinks each that's pricey. I wish them well because I think they're on to something in the neighbourhood however I think their prices may eventually hurt their business. Give them a try and see what you think."

The cocktails are exotic and a variety that I haven't seen in other places. The skewers and bowls range from savory to sweet. I had the chicken skewers, Yuzu fries and beef bowl. All A+

The size and price of the food is like tapas. Two or three skewers, bowl and app make a great meal. Some ""tapas"" restaurants have huge portions and steep prices - yuzu's are just right . Here the orders are perfect to share a few bites. 

Even though it is a new restaurant the service and flow were excellent. All the service staff were friendly and welcoming.

Now for another secret if you've made it this far in the review. The backyard patio is a secluded hideaway. Maybe six tables surrounded by a high fence and pine trees. Lakewood doesn't have enough outdoor dining options and Yuzu has one of the best."

After a bad experience with this place, I gave it another shot because it's by my house. Some friends and I went in for dinner around 8pm. One of my friends is loud and was commenting loudly on how cool the place was. We were seated and waited. And waited. The manager came over and asked us where we came from and why my friend was so loud. I explained we had not been anywhere and he was just like that. She told us we were drunk and wouldn't get served. I stated this was fine, we were looking to have dinner not drinks. She stated we weren't welcome to stay because my friend was obviously drunk and they didn't want ""people like us"" there bothering the other guests.  No one was drunk or even drinking.  Fine with me, we left and I haven't been back. Never will return.  I surely hope this is not how they treat all their customers."

This deal I'm talking about is $10 for UNLIMITED game playing from 5pm-Close on Thursdays! Awesome! I feel like they read everyone's mind because it would always be kind of pricey to play before, I feel like $20 goes so fast here and I bet that's true for a lot of parents as well. So Thursdays is the way to go! The only catch is that the games that offer tickets, well you can still play them but they don't give you tickets. Makes sense, $10 is such a steal and then you get free prizes too? No way haha That's no problem for me since I don't really care about the prizes but that definitely could be an issue for the little ones. 
My favorites are the football throwing game, skeeball, air hockey, mario kart and this other game that you knock down clowns with balls in an alotted amount of time. Also out of all of the games offered I think there were only 2 out of order so that's not too bad. As for the unlimited game play, you can't use your card at the photobooth but I didn't have a problem using it with anything else. Overall, I probably would only come here Thursdays now, I'll definitely be back!"

Are they a bar or a game/entertainment center? One second they are catering to adults with drinks and low budget tv's and steps away they are catering to 5 year old children. The bar and arcade are a very weird mix in such a small space.  This is a classic example of a jack of all trades, master of none.  If this is a restaurant /bar, there are better ones 25 feet away and if this is an arcade for children, this is Las Vegas and Circus Circus runs circles around it. I expected that this was going to be a very cool, new and innovative arcade center for all ages and was really excited for something new and different to arrive but was disappointed to say the least and would never go back.

Party of 7 came by on a Friday night with no expectations, no reservations, and a 2 year old which can usually spell out a recipe for disaster but boy did Charr impress! 

We were seated right away at a perfect size table and greeted immediately by our very friendly and very competent server. We received info on the specials as well as tips for first timers. Our drinks came right away and our server was even conscientious enough to ask if we should bring the 2 year old's food right away! (YES PLEASE!). Mr. Aiello himself came by to greet us twice and make sure that everything was perfect. 

So, what did we have? I can tell you, I had one of the best salmon burgers I've ever had in my whole life. A delicious, perfectly cooked filet atop the most delicious house made garlic knot bun. What I loved most was the fact that the bun never got soggy from the lemon basil mayo sauce and the arugula was so fresh I'd swear that it was snipped that day!  The salmon was perfectly done. The baby had housemade macaroni and cheese that every adult at the table swore was the best ever. I think we might all have it next time as a main dish ourselves. 4 different cheeses mixed in the sauce and topped with a slice of cheddar and baked to perfection. O.M.G. Several of the grown-ups had the Phoenix Burger and the Charr Burger. Everyone said the burgers were DE-LIC-IOUS and cooked to perfection since so many of us have different degrees of doneness that we prefer.  Final friend had the pork tenderloin and while that fell a tad short versus the burgers, the overall dining experience left her feeling 5 star all the way. 

Dessert was also superb. I had the Strawberries and Zabaglione sauce while others had the Apple Cobbler served hot with vanilla ice cream. All were super yum. 

While this restaurant is very out of the way for us, we will definitely be making an effort to go out of our way again to visit Charr very very soon.  Thank you for a great experience and excellent food!"

Their menu is quirky and you can't necessarily pinpoint what kind of cuisine it is, but that's what makes it so interesting!

Was a bit taken back at the fact you have to take your shoes off at this place. 
Interesting atmosphere, people bringing their own instruments to play or maybe were they there from the place for people to use, Im not sure. Little cubby hole seatings, a seat for one or larger groups, places by the window that have no seating just a raised platform with rugs to sit on with low tables for your food. Note books for people to randomly leave their mark and for you to read or view the art left by others. The crowd I would describe was quite ""earthy"". Almost like walking into a different zone all together. 
However, once I got over that and had their healthy food. Oh it was pretty tasty. Looked and was pretty simple meals but surprisingly there was some goood flavor in it too! And to know you are eating healthy - well done Bampot! Had the hummus and salad. But the pitas almost tasted like they were home made (maybe they were I didnt ask) and the salad dressing?! I asked what was in it but really they should just bottle that up and sell it. 
The tea I chose was a miss sorry to say. I think it was a chai base and apple or something I forget (was a month ago). My friend's mango one apparently was very tasty!
Only thing, the tea did not seem too hot when it came out.
The waitress got some things off, as my friend had to wait exceptionally long for her poutine soup - which they got mixed up with another dish and only told us until we questioned the long wait (my other friends were hungry and already almost finished their meal before my other friend got hers) and by that time she just changed it to the carrot soup which was already available. 
You do have to be open minded about the eclectic earthy hippy atmosphere and who ever you bring should be like that too. 
Well I am not much of a bohemian, the service is questionable at times, but Im interested in teas and healthy food that tastes good!"

Men's bathroom was run down (faucet falling off the wall), dirty, and smelled like stale urine....I understand it is a bathroom but it doesn't have to smell that way! 

My biggest beef is the price of liquor.....$7.50 for a call brand liquor (we ordered Captain Morgan/Coke and Malibu/Pineapple) served in rocks glasses. This establishment is no where near trendy enough to be running these kind of prices. I have bar tending experience and have travelled enough to know when to pay those prices and Charr is not it.

Happy hour ran from 330-500(or close to that). This didn't make much sense to me...during the week most people are barely out of work by 5.

I might return for food only if I happen to be in the area, but will never seek out or recommend Charr."

I had purchased a Groupon for a 4-person prix fixe menu for $120.  The menu was as follows:
2 x Onion Soup and Crispy Parmesan Gratin
2 x Grilled Shrimp and Calamari in a Provencal sauce
2 x Atlantic Salmon on Linguine
2 x Duck Confit with Wild-Mushroom Risotto
Dessert platter for the table
Coffee/Tea

There were a total of 6 of us, and the other 2 ordered off their weekly Prix Fixe menu for $25 which includes an appetizer and entrée.  All items marked with an asterix on the menu were available options.

From the dinner prix fixe menu, we opted for the onion soup, and the organic greens.  For mains, the Beef Bourgignon and 8 oz. New York Striploin were selected.

We also ordered 2 glasses of wine, a Merlot and a Cabernet Sauvignon.  I am not a fan of red wines to begin with, but I found the Cabernet to be too sour for my taste buds.  The Merlot was much more subtle.

Upon ordering, we were brought 2 warm bread baskets.  Those of you who know me know how excited I get when I am served warm bread, or how bratty I get when I am served cold bread :p  It was a poppy seed bread served with balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil.  From what I gather, it is a store-bought bread and not bought daily as the bread, though I won't say stale was not the freshest. The French Onion Soup was disappointing to say the least.  The lack of deep onion flavour and gooey cheese coupled with a little too much wine in the broth made for a rather sour taste.  More cheese and more onions = more flavour.  The math is quite easy folks!  The only part of this dish that was tasty was the crostini. The Grilled Shrimp and Calamari in a Provencal sauce was served almost cold which was indicative that it had been waiting for awhile since the chef prepared it to reach our table.  The calamari was nicely grilled, soft and tender but unfortunately the shrimp were overcooked.  The salad came adorned with olives and a balsamic drizzle.  Overall, this dish was all one flavour - tart, mostly stemming from vinaigrette and tomatoes.  It would've been nice for some contrast.The Salmon Linguine was made with a simple sauce which really brought out the flavour of the fish.  The salmon for me was the best part as the skin was crispy and the fish was flaky.  The linguine was rather bland, with a lemon-oil drizzle.  So you can imagine how excited I was when the server brought over the Parmesan cheese for sprinkling!The Duck Confit came with your choice of sauce: veal jus, orange jus, or blueberry jus. We opted for the veal and orange jus.  The duck had a nice crisp skin, but it was more of a crust than anything else.  It resembled the texture of a chicken wing that's been sitting on the grill a little too long.  The risotto was barely warm and a bit dry.  The side vegetables were tender and savoury.

I also got to sample both the sirloin and the beef bourgignon.  The steak was quite flavourful and had a nice charred flavour to it.  Taste was all there, but texturally, it was a tad on the dry side.  The frites were amazing!  I love crispy fries.  Ketchup wasn't even on my mind when I was chowing these down.  That must be a sure sign that they were tasty?  I found the red wine in the beef bourgignon to be overpowering, but my mom thought it was fine.  My only ""beef"" about this dish is that I wish the meat were more tender.The Groupon specified that a dessert tray would be served. The serving size was more suitable for a party of 2 than it was for a party of 4.  It consisted of a Crème Brûlée, Blueberry Strudel and Raspberry Sorbet with blueberries, gooseberries and raspberries for garnish.  I was unimpressed with their  crème brûlée which was grainy and not velvety smooth.  The raspberry sorbet was quite refreshing.  The strudel was more what I would call a dessert spring roll and had a crisp exterior and yummy filling!  The house coffee was also quite good.  My parents, who you have never applauded any restaurant for good coffee finally cracked and awarded their first ever java compliment.

Verdict:

I haven't experienced service like this in a very long time.  The servers were very attentive, courteous and sported a smile.  Food-wise I was a little disappointed but it wasn't terrible.  It someone were to ask for recommendations, Alizé wouldn't be on the top of the list but if I were in the area I may eat here again... Perhaps ordering off their regular menu would serve as a better basis of comparison.  Until then, I reserve judgment."
"hgAfKGJowMXeRYWgliczMA","Brian","n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA","GameWorks","5","2014-12-08 00:00:00","This Gameworks location is great and is far better than almost any other arcade style restaurant venue anywhere near the vicinity of the Las Vegas area.  Of the comments by others that criticise this Gameworks, it is often that this location lacks some of the greatness of other or past Gameworks locations.  While some of that I agree with, the comparison should be Gameworks now compared to their competitors now, not Gameworks compared to themselves of the past.

The dining areas, bar areas, bowling areas, arcade areas, and the console gaming areas all look great.  The arcade prices generally are about four credits per game, which is one dollar with no promotions or bulk purchase of credits whatsoever.  Most generic arcades in the major hotels would have similar pricing, yet Gameworks provides a much nicer, friendlier and healthier enviroment than going inside a Las Vegas hotel/casino.  In addition, they have deals, 190 credits for $27, making that one-dollar game just 57 cents.  The pricing is good; I do not see where some of these complaints come from.  It is a far better value than Dave and Busters located throughout the country.

The Las Vegas design is different than many other Gameworks, but that is fine.  I personally do not understand the space given to console internet computer gaming, but that may appeal to others.  If that does not work out as expected, a great idea would be to expand the arcade space, which is what many arcade enthusiasts want to happen.  Maybe put in a clever time tunnel entrance and have some great, nearly forgotten games from the 80s and 90s in there that nearly no one has anymore (possibly locate a game list from when the first Gameworks opened, and replicate some of it).  If management wants an idea of games, I would be glad to submit some ideas, or go on killer list of videogames dot com for a blast from the past reminder of games that once existed.  Possibly, add a few more classic cabinets to overflow and transition between sections, so the place is not quite so compartmentalized.  All of this is not a complaint, just ideas to make this new Gameworks even better and enhance it with some classic nestalgia from Gameworks past.

In closing, Gameworks Las Vegas does not deserve an average rating less than four stars.  Those who live in the area should enjoy what it has to offer instead of comparing it to absolute arcade perfection.  Again, compare it to what little else is present in Las Vegas family fun, enjoy the games and the environment of fun that exists inside all Gameworks locations.  I do want to also mention that in my opinion many other Gameworks, current and past, deteriorated over time.  Please do not allow entropy to set in here, please keep the games well maintained and focus on customer service and Gameworks will do well."

Such overt sexism is normally reserved for the strip clubs.  Last year, a growing chain named the Brick House opened up what is most like an upscale Hooters on Howe Ave. in the Falls, just a few hundred feet northwest of Chapel Hill Mall.  In day 4 of the Alcoholocaust (what I'm calling my last week in Akron), a friend and I went to visit this place to watch the Tribe game and get drunk.

This is a man's place.  If you are a woman, there's a good chance you won't enjoy being here - especially like the guys do.  We came into the place to see girls ranked anywhere from 4-8 on a 1-10 scale dressed in short shorts and shirts exposing part of their stomachs.  My friend and I would intentionally order beers from the lower racks just to see them bend over, but they are only dressing that way to tease you.  They aren't supposed to bend over completely, which is a let down for a lot of guys (I'm here for the game and beer, so it wasn't a biggie).  They have a large number of TVs within the place, as well as a lounge area for the guys to just chillax.  And, of course, there's the average-to-hot waitresses to socialize with.

The first thing we noticed (other than the girls) was how much money was shelled into the layout.  The bar had a fireplace, an expensive paint job, upscale lighting, and an all-wooden patio.  No other place would throw in $1 million to make a dining and/or drinking experience this nice.  The next thing we noticed was the beer selection.  The beer selection is impressive for a chain.  They have the shitty domestic beers, but then you work your way up to microbrews such as Thirsty Dog, Hop Devil, and Pilsner Urquell.  They also have an average menu serving food of average quality.  We ordered some wings that were dipped in 4 different sauces and served with celery.  The wings were acceptable, but it was really obvious that they were frozen at one point; they had that formaldehyde-ish taste that Wing Street and The Lube have.  Everything here is quite overpriced, despite the better-than-average selection.  The average price for a beer was $4.50, while the average price for a shot was well over $7.

At the end of the night, the Tribe blew a 3-0 lead thanks to the wonderfully predictable pitching of Joe Smith, and we were hammered.  I was even talking about how much I love Yelping (which I never talk about with non-Yelp friends unless they ask).  While I has happy with the girls and the selection, a $20 tab for a Washington Apple, a Hop Devil, a PBR, and wings might be a few bucks more than at other bars I can be found at in Akron.  If you are into an upscale drinking experience and are fine with restaurants that exploit the female body such as this, then this is the place for you.  If not, you are better off staying home."

Let's start off with approaching the place. I get that it's Harbord St. in Toronto, but really? It looks like a run down shack with a sign. Entering, you see some art; some is quite nice, and the idea to support young local artists is excellent, but do I REALLY need to see a FOUR ARMED WOMAN WITH HER ENTRAILS FALLING OUT OF HER while I eat and sip tea?! I think NOT! Absolutely TACKY décor from the 1950s, this place needs to be vacated and renovated with a nuclear weapon.

The tea: You would think that, being a teahouse and all, that they'd have a tea list on their website, but they don't. First strike. Second strike? The tea is frigid. The water is always lukewarm to ice cold. Third strike? It tastes gross. The fairy's blood tea (what a morbid name, gross!) tastes as though it was created by Paula Deen on psilocybins. It's like...liquid soap with some weeds from the garden, it's FOUL. And don't go ""teehee my tea is organic and has x, y, z as health benefits,"" because they do not. They're teas, not magic. They do not heal you or help anything but quench thirst, or scald a tongue. In this case, they ruin your day.

The food: while some of it does indeed appear nice, their menu is really all over the place! You don't go from ""poutine soup"" (Yes, it's as disgusting as it sounds. It's watery gravy with half-baked potatoes, and stringy white cheese), to baklava and sahlep! Speaking of which, REALLY? If you're going to serve food from another culture, it better be spot-on, otherwise this is just some wannabe crap that's insulting. Unfortunately, it falls into the latter category, and it's offensive. You sahlep should not be dirty dishwater, and your baklava should not be some frozen, store-bought nonsense! Unacceptable! And RESELLING CHEERIOS? CHEERIOS? GET OUT! OUT, OUT, OUT!

Removing shoes at the door sounds cute in retrospect, but quite frankly, I don't want to smell other people's nasty shoes! 

Service was rude, and the workers only talked to white people like myself. The Arab girls in the place were completely ignored, despite being paying customers. This place is honestly like a gentrification cafe, it's just disappointing.

The store's house should read ""MONDAY THROUGH SUNDAY: CLOSED!"""

We had the flank steak in Marsala sauce.  My dining partner nearly licked the plate it was so delicious.  The potato croquet that accompanied it was also totally yummy--crispy on the outside and fluffy and cheesy on the inside.  Service has been great every time we've been there, prompt and attentive but not intrusive.  The burgers are always lovely, juicy and done as requested --a perfect pink medium rare--and the fries are addictive.  Monday night is bargain burger night and a complete steal.  Love this place!  A great addition to the Moon Valley neighborhood. The owner has been in the house every time we've been here and he always checks in to make sure we're enjoying our meal.  When they first opened, the fries were not included with the burger entrees, but they have since remedied that, which was a really good decision."

This is like a Maggiano's, but on a smaller scale. The hostess was nice and friendly upon walking in.  Be warned that the place is small and does not fit a party of 8 easily.  We had to wait for half an hour for an early Friday dinner and it wouldn't have been so bad had they not told us it was only going to take 10 min.  Anyway, got past that and got seated.  We ordered and ate family style:  Linguine Pescatore, Spaghetti, Pasta Carrabba, Lobster Ravioli, Seafood Cannelloni, Italian Chicken, and Calamari.  We wanted to order the Antipasti Plate and thought we did but the waiter, brought out a sampler appetizer dish instead. This leads me to my complaint:  we saw our waiter 3 times AT MOST.  It didn't look terribly busy that night but we never saw him.  He was pleasant when we did see him but that was rare.  We had to ask someone else for water refills and were constantly looking for our waiter.  It was quite odd.  We would have corrected the wrong appetizer dish but we were afraid we would never eat if we never saw him and ended up waiting longer for our food.  The owner of this establishment should be aware that the servers are not attentive and it's a darn shame!

Onto the food:  The Linguine Pescatore was boring and didn't have much flavor, Spaghetti tasted like something from a jar, Calamari was WAY to salty (even the marinara sauce couldn't compensate), Pasta Carrabba was not memorable, Lobster Ravioli was done well with good/rich flavor in an orange sauce, Seafood Cannelloni wonderfully creamy filling but a small portion, and the pizza was dry.  Overall, Carrabbas was not a good place for a meal.  The prices are about right from a place like this ($12 -$18 a dish) and the atmosphere is decent.  However, it was really annoying we never saw our waiter and that is just unforgivable."

Also the yelp hours listed never seem to match what they're open. Last time as we were leaving another couple showed up thinking they were open till 10 weekdays. 

Here's the saddest part, I love the location and the menu. But the wait staff is so unwelcoming it's amazing. First visit ( we think they're open till 10(yelp listed) we show up at 8:15. At 8:45 while eating our entrees the waitress turns off the fire and starts closing down. Ok ok we're done can we have a box?  Tonight our waitress had three tables (all outside) we ordered a salad and an appetizer and twenty minutes later they show up with our entree right behind when we ordered them at least 10 minutes apart. Our waitress spent the majority of her time in at the bar with the other staff eating pasta from a to go container from somewhere. 

Ok also don't order the veggie burger. I know I know it's a meat place, but I was trying to make a healthy option tonight. Tasted like when I tried a Pinterest fail recipe. Just get a burger."

For our entrees I picked the mushroom & brie burger and my boyfriend got the phoenix burger which both came with truffle fries. The server failed to ask how we wanted our burgers done and without being asked I forgot to specify so I ended up with a well done burger which I'm not into. The flavors were there just the fact that it was overcooked ruined it for me. My boyfriend enjoyed his though. The fries were phenomenal!

ATMOSPHERE - Outstanding atmosphere! So cozy and colourful, the Morrocan-themed and earthy-inspired decor is so well selected, with great attention to detail. There are a variety of seating options - from seated platforms, to the standard table & chairs, to armchairs and couches. 

TEA - They have more than 50 teas of all kinds of varieties - including specialty blends with hand-blended herbs and seasonings - which come by the pot at reasonable prices (which vary depending on the tea). Give yourself some time with the tea menu! It will tempt you in all different directions.

FOOD - Plenty of options to nosh on. Daily main, usually a curry, and a daily soup. Nice selection of both savoury and sweet snacks. All at decent prices. I had the best chocolate cake I've ever had! Check out the much-loved Bampot original: poutine soup!

GAMES - Good selection of board games! Nicely organized and categorized in the board game library. 

* Bonuses * 
- HOOKAHS - Tobacco-free shisha in many flavours! 
- ACCESSIBILITY - Barrier-free entrance (ramp to doorway) and barrier-free washroom on main floor.

As a former LAN-Center manager, I can tell you that this place gets a lot of things right. You can swing by and even watch some of the large tournaments. They recently hosted a Hearthstone Nats Qualifier, League of Legends LCS qualifier, and have nightly tournaments. Specifically, Veronica, Nancy, and Marlon are some of their all-stars.

The place wasn't super busy, but there were still plenty of people eating. When we walked in we were not greeted by the gaggle of hostesses standing by the door, in fact the didn't say a single word to us, but looked very annoyed that we happened to walk in the door right then. One of them quickly grabbed two menus, rolled her eyes at us and started walking away, before I realized we were supposed to be following her, I asked for a table on the patio. Begrudgingly she took us outside and sat us without another word.

I was going to let this all slide as ill-tempered hostesses. Fine. Our server was friendly and happy to help us with a drink order. We ordered the calamari, fried zucchini and the greek meatballs to share based on recommendations here on yelp. The food came out quickly and we dug in. The calamari was cooked well, not rubbery. The fried zucchini was bland and tasted like old flyer oil, maybe an off night right? The meatballs were just plain terrible. Flavorless, soggy, lumps of meatloaf with mashed cucumbers under them. We finished maybe half of each platter.

I don't normally write reviews here, and I don't like to complain, but the whole experience was just plain bad. The worst part of it, by the time my girlfriend and I got home we both felt ill. Maybe too much deep fried food? Maybe bad meatballs? I don't know. Either way I spent the rest of my night in the bathroom. Fair warning to any future guests."

We were seated for 10-15 minutes before anyone came over to our table.  Waitress was awkward and possibly on drugs (?!).  We got our appetizers 30 minutes after ordering.  When our entree eventually came, it was cooked incorrectly and was incomplete, missing sides of French fries for each burger.  

The owner came by our table several times making crass jokes and being offensive. The waitress unapologetically blamed the slow service on ""trivia night"" and only being staffed with two waitresses.  To top it off when we go to address our experience with management, the rude owner comes over and tells us to GET OUT, mocks our concerns, and asks us to never come back. NEVER have I felt more uncomfortable and offended than during my visit to Charr.

I first tasted their food at a Multiple Sclerosis Society event called Cooks & Chords. They were offering tastings to support the cause, and I wanted to support them after seeing their efforts. Absolutely loved the crabcake burger with tartar. Truffle fries are amazing, and wow the portions. Enough for dinner and lunch the next day. Service was top notch, very quick. Appetizers are awesome, I particularly liked the fried zucchini. Perfect spot for lunch or dinner when in Moon Valley. Must check out if you're in the neighborhood."

Location: I love the new location in Town Square compared to the old location on the strip. It is below the AMC movie theatre and across from Yard House. It is close to a bunch of good bars and restaurants. Here are a few: Yard House, Capriotti's, Mcfaddens, Sugar Factory. 

Interior: When you walk in the front doors there is a service station to your left and a seating area, there is also seating on the exterior if you prefer that. The bar is 20ft from the front door. The bar was average in size with a good selection of alcohol, we ordered a jack with coke and Malibu mix drink, both were $6 so that's not bad. Then you have a decent selection of arcade games and various other gaming machines, there was a variation of air hockey which would throw out about 20 mini discs at once, now that was fun and intense. There was a glow in the dark pool table area and bowling lanes which I did not try but will next time.

Staff: The bar staff was good. There was a hipster looking white male who made us feel at home, explained the changes to the new menu, and helped us when needed. There was a short hispanic male who was in the bar area and didn't seem to do much, I'm not sure if he was the manager but he was rude to the staff and extremely bossy. The staff at the ticket counter were good and helped us get the correct amount of points on our card after a machine error.

We will be back soon to try the glow in the dark things and as the drinks are $2 cheaper than Mcfaddens which is upstairs."

Stopped in for late lunch on a Sunday. We kept it pretty straightforward. I had a Charr Burger with Cheddar Cheese. It was nicely cooked to medium rare. My girlfriend opted for the Chicken Grill. Both turned out to be good choices. The garlic knot bun for the burger is unique and buttery good. The meat could have used a bit more seasoning, but still had good flavor. The truffle fries were an excellent companion piece to the whole meal.

In the end, our waiter, Gino, was kind enough to give us some extra garlic knot buns to take home. Had a sandwich on one for dinner that night.

The burger world is the crowded spot these days, but Charr does have a home in it."

The whole different arcade games some throwbacks, current games, and interactive games with the EA sport area not mention the indoor bowling alley. Not forget about the little ones for games earn tickets then redeem them later. The whole bar/restaurant area that something like but not fan at the same time. It nice that they offer good diversity of food not your basic bar menu grub all deep fried or off the grill. I like the location of this GameWorks in Town Square Mall on the strip. I like the fact they serve beers by the pitchers as option!  I like fact that tons of televisions all over the place in the bar and restaurant area for sports. Not fan the bar area. It hardly feels like bar area that can lounge around and relax with friends. Your right smack next to the entrance so see people coming and going or kids running around. It could be good thing free entertainment. LOL. The service was awful. I went up two separate occasions the first time. Not sure if he was bartender or bar back. The guy cleaning glasses working not once did he acknowledge me. I literally was standing in front of his face the whole time. Hi. Someone will be with you. The other two bartenders just whatever I had get there attention just get drink. The bar had no personality feel like counter top in middle of open space. The restaurant area itself not much better with personality feels like more cafeteria setting I feel just open space with tables and couple booths outside. Service at times was not on it. To be fair came to GameWorks after friends wedding reception for night cap get together. Everyone showed at random times. They did do fabulous job with no reservations rearrange tables (we helped moved them or they did) ended up with over 30 peeps spread out over three or four tables. Well done. 

I had some of my friends food. I tried the pretzel bites. They were ok. The cheese sauce tasted out of can. The nachos that was solid. It was loaded with pretty much everything. Really all the food saw coming out to the table looked good. 

If playing tourist GameWorks is place that might stop by again. If want throw back days in 808 going Tilt or Fun Factory (local peeps would appreciate the shout out) would go GameWorks. The food and drinks honest so many other great spots in Town Square would skip that part at GameWorks."

Service began with white and red wine. I ordered more than one light and refreshing sangria's this evening. Sara makes this sacred sangria with her secret ingredient Grand Marnier. This very berry refreshing drink is a great way to enjoy summer dinners.

Course one is mixed baby greens and cold antipasto platters of prosciutto, souprisatta, spek, housemade mozzarella, provolone ,grilled vegetables, roasted peppers, marinated artichokes with a country mix of earthy, delectable olives.

Course two for me was  Linguine Fra Diavolo with shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari hot pepper bite. Fra Divalo translates as ""Brother Devil"", hinting that this dish is a little spicy but it was mild enough.

Out of respect I wanted to thank Joe for the fabulous meal and the wonderful staff because as Don Corleone once said ""Friendship is everything. Friendship is more than talent. It is more than the government. It is almost the equal of family"". -Mario Puzo."

I used to go to the GameWorks on the Strip when I was kid. I mean, I even remember going to the original grand opening and losing mind because it was so amazing, two stories of video games! That's a lot for a 14-year-old boy to handle. Now this new GameWorks location is in Town Square and it's not like the one of yesteryear, but more of a sports bar fused with a Chuck E. Cheese. 

They added a few new things like a full bowling alley, which looks amazing, a huge bar for the alcoholic pinball lovers, and a few hundred TVs. I like the lay out here also; there are two main entrances on each side of the building, which is super convenient, and the length of the bar is great because I don't like feeling like I'm sitting on the guy next to me. The have an okay mix of games, but I feel like they need to incorporate more of the classics. They have ""Donkey Kong"" and ""Centipede"", plus a few others, but this isn't enough of the old school favorites. I hate to say it, but my age and demo will be the main customers frequenting this place and if you don't up the nostalgia factor here you might be setting yourself up for the ultimate, GAME OVER. The other side of this is most ""little"" kids or hardcore gamers would rather stay in their room and play ""Call of Duty"" with some other kid from Germany. They don't want to be bothered with socializing or paying for something they already have at home. I'm voting for Super Mario 3!

Once I was done playing Skee-Ball and destroying some T-1000s on the Terminator shooter game I needed something in my belly. I still had stuff to do that day so I ordered a Cesar salad and some fries, you know...keeping it lite. These were good by ""Barcade"" standards. The salad was big and fresh and the french fries came with this cocktail sauce infused ketchup, pretty tasty! Of course I had to order a cocktail before I left, ""One Moscow Mule please"". (keeping it lite) This was actually the shining light of my visit. Sweet, tangy, and refreshing with just enough vodka and ginger. 

All in all, it was an OK experience and I feel like they are still working out some of the kinks, hence the three star rating. It's definitely not the GameWorks that was stuck in my memory, but I will be back to give it a second chance. Plus, who else will dominate all the little kids on the Pac-Man Air Hockey game."

Not knowing what to expect, since although I've heard great things about Alize in general, usually the winter/summerlicious events seem to be a mediocre sampling into what you can usually expect from the  menu.

I made a reservation for 5 people a week earlier, and when we made it at the exact time specified, we were told to wait in the cold doorway till they prepared the tables. We waited for about 10-15 minutes, and the restaurant itself wasn't very busy yet. 

The menu options were diverse and more than acceptable with 3-4 per course. I had the Potato and Leek Soup, Barbequed Salmon and Tiramisu. One of my friends thought the crepe was distinctly too dry. 

The Potato soup and Tiramisu were both very mediocre, and my biggest shocker of the night was finding a strand of black hair intertwined in my friend's entree(bbq'ed salmon). When she alerted the server, all she got was a very quiet apology, the plate was taken away and replaced. 

That's it. 

We were all left gagging for several minutes at a shocker that should have never taken place in a restaurant, much less one like Alize. Worse still, to have a similar situation addressed by the restaurant as though the salmon was just simply overcooked. 

That would have been acceptable. Hair in food, is not. 

Further, the friend and I (had the exact same choices) have been experiencing stomach trouble since last night. I suspect the salmon. It's a shame, because the restaurant itself is so cute."

Usually I crave restaurants that are consistent. But Brick House is consistently terrible at timing the arrival of appetizers and entrees. This happens all the time! You get your appetizers, then the food shows up before you can take a bite. I hate that. I wanted to give two stars, but some of the food is actually tasty, so they get three.

We don't even order our food and appetizers at the same time because of this issue. I guess you have to wait until the appetizers arrive to order entrees if you want to enjoy them.

There's some tasty treats here that I recommend - zucchini curls, the breading is really tasty and I like the parmesan cheese on top. However, they ran out of siracha ranch and instead of making more, brought out regular ranch. Huh? Go make more. Which is what they did, when I asked them to please bring the correct dipping sauce.

My husband ordered the meatloaf, which sounded interesting. It was very tasty. I would order that on a future visit. 

I like the French Onion soup - my mom doesn't like that they use smoked provolone, but I thought it was still good and would order again soon.

The calamari is a super treat - with large whole pieces, not the little crappy rings you find elsewhere.

I ordered the roast chicken - which really was grilled, but a whole half! That's a lot of chicken. I really would have preferred a veggie with this instead of just mashed potatoes. And the potatoes were listed as including cheddar but I had none of that. My husband's potatoes too - maybe they ran out!

My parents order the same items every time (pretzel stick appetizer), mahi mahi, and either fish n chips or shrimp (sometimes fries, sometimes tots - I love that they have tots, I am such a fan!).

I do not recommend the mac and cheese. It's terrible. They served it to me cold - not hot at all. Then I requested they add a few little bits of jalapeno - I got a boat load of teensy tiny jalapenos - they covered at least a 1/2 inch at the bottom of the bowl. And the bacon was gross - it was too fatty and in huge chunks. This made the entire thing pretty much inedible. Then, they served it to me cold. Yes, not hot, not warm, cool. How did they make it right? They reheated it! Yuck. Now it was dryer than the desert. How did they make it right? They took it off the bill. It still doesn't erase the memories of that disgusting dish.

Oh - I know I'll be back because my parents are regular diners there - so it's their go-to place. Plus, compared to nearby restaurants like Olive Garden or Applebees (bleh Chains), this has less crowd and more space. I like the fire. I love the patio. I like the bar. I like the stylish seating areas even though my folks require a table."

A few comments from my first (and last) visit to your restaurant: My girlfriend and I stopped on 05/12 around 4:20 pm for what we thought was going to be happy hour and dinner. We walked into an empty location, but it was early so no big deal being the only people there. We were seated in the dining room (where I wiped crumbs and food off the booth before I sat down... server didn't notice or care) and I asked the server if they had a happy hour menu. She said ""happy hour specials are only available at the bar and if you sit outside"". Kind of a surprise, but I get the idea. She then asked ""do you want to hear the happy hour specials"" and my response was ""well since we aren't sitting outside what is the point?"" She didn't seem to get the joke, and told us the specials anyway. Those included some deals on draft beer, wine, and food, but then she said there wasn't any tap beer tonight so it would be bottles on special. We looked around at a completely empty dining room and commented that it seemed odd to be so rigid on a happy hour (that ended at 5 according to your site) when there wasn't a single other person inside or outside. We didn't come in for cheap drinks, and we actually joked on the drive over that it was so close to the end of happy hour that we were prepared to pay full price anyway. The whole attitude of the place didn't communicate that we were appreciated as customers, the server and the other 2 staff seemed to be prepping or something else, so we opted to leave. Reading the reviews on various online blogs and the media articles, we expected much better. The food may be great, but the service and ridiculous ""happy hour rules"" will keep me from coming back to find out. I can only imagine what the response would have been if I had ordered something and asked for a substitution. We actually went to another option down the road and were thrilled with the experience. Having been in the hospitality industry in an executive position, I realize that things happen. I am simply writing to tell the owner of my experience, and what my observations were. In a competitive world where there are at least 30 other food options within half a mile of yours, the rigid rules, the poor service added to a dirty restaurant adds up in the customer's buying decision... it certainly did factor in mine tonight. My $50 plus dollars spent at a competitor seemed more appreciated by them than at your place."

I went here for dinner on a Friday with a sorority sister because she had recommended it. It has a great location in morth Phoenix and hosts a beautiful fire pit fitted outisde patio, but was a little chilly for outside dining that night. We opted for a table in the middle of the place, my only complant was that I got the chair and my sister got the booth. In the chair, I felt like I was a foot above her and it was a little uncomfortable to sit that way.

None the less, the service was fantastic. We each ordered drinks and were hand delivered by a nice bartender. We could see the hustle and bustle of the kitchen from our seats and with an open air kitchen like that it really fills the room with the right amount of noise. We got an app, friend zucnini with ranch dipping sauce. They were alright. I wish they had a bigger crunch when you bite in but they also cut really nicely for nibbling perfection. 

I got the The Buffalo Chicken while my sister orded the Grilled Chicken. Mine came with the most melty, amazing, mouth watering white cheese. That was my favorite part. The bread was great and the chicken too. Not enough buffalo sauce but the blue cheese dipping sauce was on point.

The place is owned by the funny Italian guy and he was just hanging around the place. He speaks poor english but is super friendly and will always ask you how your meal was. I'd go back."

They use black Angus beef, have turkey burgers that are huge, and a black bean based veggie burger too. Gluten free buns are an option. You can have fries with white truffle oil or homemade mac-n-cheese. A side salad or sweet potato fries are a buck more, and homemade onion rings are a couple of bucks more, but are yummy. They have two slider options for appetizers where the garlic knot bun's are homemade. The chili wings are tasty. They have great portion salad options in case a burger is not what your wanting. The shakes are a great compliment. They have a few desserts. I had the warmed brownie with vanilla bean ice cream, whipped cream and more chocolate syrup on top. Did I mention they have a full bar, and many craft beers on tap. So many choices I did not list."

They also have a decent happy hour after 9pm. I usually go with my girlfriend at least once a week we really enjoy it!

Haven't used the other part of gameworks at all. Seems like its way to bunched together they need to open up the dining area to more games I never see anyone using the dining room anyways. Just my thoughts!"

"JpQIdPw1ecBcePJepkWWag","Rob","1WBkAuQg81kokZIPMpn9Zg","Charr An American Burger Bar","5","2012-08-31 00:00:00","Well I finally got around to doing a writeup on charr. The reviews here seem mixed so I had to check it out for myself. The first thing I noticed was the setup -- the multi-color backlit bar and the nice flat-screen LED tvs. I'm a big football fan so I will be sure to come by to eat and never miss a game! 

I came for dinner and was seated very quickly by the hostess. Menu had a wide selection of appetizers, salads, soups and drinks. Went for the charrburger with some custom toppings to my liking, beer on tap, and crab cakes to start. Some other reviews mentioned about price but having sampled other places in phoenix like Delux  I found the prices to be quite on par. More on what I think of the value later.

I got my crab cakes to start and they were excellent! Very moist, tasty and hit the spot. Next was my burger and it was quite a burger. The garlic knot bun turns out to be the differentiator between the other joints I ate at so I give charr the nod on the taste of the burgers. I thought the food was excellent and certainly of the best I have had.

Whether it is charr or the other burger places I sampled that serve high quality gourmet burgers, I think the price is very reasonable. This is not processed meat and the quality of the food, the ambiance where I can kick back and watch the games on the flat screen tvs and hang with my buddies makes it well worth the price. I dont plan on coming every night but at the end of a hard week of work it's nice to have a place to hang with both my buddies and colleagues for some drinks and/or food. If I want a cheap burger I can always get a big mac at the other end of the mall but I always regret it later when I choose fast food over quality.

Overall, I enjoyed my meal and the atmosphere and the service. I liked the other burger joints I have been trying as well but give the nudge to charr. I'd say try it out for yourself. Tip: waited at the bar for buddies to arrive afterwards for drinks and surprisingly found some cool outlets right under the bartop I could charge my pda while waiting. Very hard to find outlets to charge my phone while I am out so this was a nice bonus! They are kind of hidden under the counter so not sure this is well known!"

We should have known we were in for a disaster when the poorly designed dining room (dumpy leather couch  from someone's dorm room in the way too-big waiting area?) only had one table of people at 8:30pm on a Friday night. But we had been looking forward to checking the place out for so long we let them seat us anyhow and tried to make the best of it by straining our necks to watch the too-small, misplaced TV's and ordering some food off of the very few options on their 1-page, Kinko's printed menu with too-small font. 

While waiting for our food, we watched the wait staff deliver a plate of nachos to an empty table by the front door/windows (where hundreds of people walked by, looked in at the boring scene, and kept on moving). The employees proceeded to grab a few nachos here and there every time they passed by, and a few even sat down to eat. I thought maybe they were off the clock until one of them left the nachos, went in the back, and came back out with our food delivery. 

The food was just so-so and not at all worth the price. I asked the server for some salt for my french fries and she dropped off an actual cup with salt in it and then started to walk off (as if this was the norm). I asked if there were any salt shakers, she said no, and then walked back to her own table of food. 

 I wish I could rate the game area but it's completely blocked off from the bar and restaurant (WHY??) and the dining experience was such a disappointing and boring downer that we decided to leave and head across to Yard House and Blue Martini to finish our date night instead.  

 We will never be going back here and my prediction is that it will be closed within a year unless some SERIOUS changes are made."

I loved Aiello's when it was open and I like the Salumeria they have next door. Charr  was decent but not overwhelmingly good.

The atmosphere is nice... I like the decor. Most of the servers are attractive young males.

I had a Moscow Mule which was refreshing and potent. I thought the drinks, including the beer were overpriced.

My husband ordered the Charr burger, cooked medium rare. He said it came medium well. He still thought the beef tasted good though. 

I ordered the roasted veggie sandwich. It was okay. The aioli that came on it was delicious. The bun that both my sandwich and my husband's burger came on was good and I liked the idea but it came apart on both of us.

The fries were thin and crispy and yummy but our server only brought out one serving for us to share. I noticed other tables of two each had their own serving... hmmmm. Luckily we were more than full despite sharing one serving of fries.

Service was good except for when my husband had to flag someone down for some mayo after getting our food. It took a solid 5 minutes. 

Our total bill before the Groupon discount for 2 burgers, fries, and 2 alcoholic beverages was around $45. A little overpriced for a burger date night.

We will return for happy hour. The drinks were tasty and I am eager to try some of their appetizers."

This was the worst service I have experienced at any restaurant that I can remember.
The food is also not as good they used to have delicious garlic knot kind of buns. now they taste like bag of 8 buns that you get at Fry's for .99 gents. for a 12 dollar burger you will have to forgive me but I expect a little more.
this is unfortunate that they have gone so far downhill I used to really like to go here. I will not be returning."

The service is all you can say like a fast food restaurant.  The server expects you to know what to order if it is your turn.  Be quick and precise, not to hesitate.  

The food though maintains its standard.  Each of the different dishes that our group has tried has a good comment.  The club sandwich is large and thick, enough to fill up any person together with fries.  The ox tail rice unexpectedly the ox tail is cut into very thick pieces so it looks piling up on the rice.  The ox tail is very well cooked and tender but the tip you can still taste a bit of the raw tail - can be done better.  The chicken comes with a salad and rice and the portion is large.  The Borsch is tasty and a bit too much tomato paste.  Most of the sauces are really thick and can fill your stomach really fast.

The lunch serving is very slow, may be due to the number of customers."

The service was good -- not the fastest coffee I've ever gotten -- but my Hawaiian Caramel Salt Iced Latte was excellent. I also ordered a blondie, something my mom used to make for me as a treat, so I was really happy to see that on the menu. I was a little turned off when it came out of a box, but it was pretty comparable to my mom's blondies, so I can't complain. 

The store was very clean and nicely decorated. A woman commented on the Labrador Granite countertops while I was there, which apparently means something. The shop had a very earthly feel about it. Four or five wooden high top tables made it a nice place to go and get some work done. Free Wifi -- something I feel like should be synonymous with ""coffeeshop."" The highest ticket menu item is a penny shy of $8. There are paninis, sandwiches, salads, etc... so it's really affordable, though I can't attest to the quality of food today, I'll definitely be back.

Another big plus for me was the music selection: today's alternative rock with a few throwbacks. My favorite was a blues rock rendition of Kanye & Jamie Foxx's ""Gold Digger.""  

Honestly, I'm just trying to figure out how I'm the first person to review this place. There were good people, good vibes, and good coffee. This might be the best kept secret of Houston, Pa."

When I first walked in I must say it was an impressive sight. Lots of redemption games and the familiar cluster of noises reminded me of that an arcade is supposed to be. 

But my son and his friends were more interested in the e-sports room, particularly in Mario Kart on the Wii U. When we found out they hold Mario Kart tournaments he was super excited. But concerned parents BEWARE!!!!!! These events along with many others are hosted by an outside person. So like any responsible parent I did a little research on this person who I will leave anonymous. Although I have had no interactions with this person personally, based on some of the vulgarity he posts on Twitter and watching some of his videos, I do not know how a large company like GameWorks could associate with such a person. He is not only unprofessional on his social media but also has no concern for censoring himself around younger people during hosted events it seems. My son was disappointed when I told him he could not attend any of these events but I feel it's my responsibility as a parent is to not allow him to come to these events based on the personality involved. Perhaps these events are geared more for ""adults"" then it shouldn't be kid games or GameWorks should do a little more research on who they have working for them."

Definitey make reservations b/c as the new ""it"" place it gets PACKED.  We got a table for 2 outside on the first level patio.  The tables are tiny and squished together so you get to know your neighbours well.  In our case this was a good thing as we talked about the food with the couple beside us (who were just about to leave).

We ordered several tacos - a few each of the spicy mushroom, the shrimp and the chicken to share.  All in all they were ok but I felt they were lacking some acidity/zing to them.  They got a little soggy as well so a bit difficult to eat.  Nothing spectacular.  We also ordered the churros/ice cream on the advice of our table neighbours.  You can never go wrong with churros!  They were delicious but honestly it isn't hard to screw them up

I think the draw of this place is the outdoor patios.  On the first level, the middle of the restaurant has those lounge-y outdoor garden patio sets where you can sink back and relax with your drink.  Very nice place to chill - right by the tiki bar.  Yes they have a tiki bar.  It's all things kitsch with the décor.

The service is really friendly if a bit slow, but understandable as it was slammed that particular Saturday.  

I might come back for some drinks but I think I'll pass on the food unless I'm super hungry."

Having said that, I am an adult that likes to obtain the occasional cocktail, and I was pleasantly surprised with the level of service from what I can easily see as a great bartender: Erica Gueco. She was nice, personable, amiable, and attentive to my needs, all while expertly handling of the needs of the many other patrons. She is a credit to this establishment and a great person to have on the front lines. Though, with all the great food joints perched so closely to this place, and the general lack of consistency I've experienced here as far as the menu goes, I would have to say pass on the food. Just get drinks, from Erica if you're lucky."

Pros:

- Nice backyard patio
- Fairly quick service (only 5 tables were seated though)

Cons:
- Drinks were pricey for 150ml cups
- Everything had wayyy too much salt in it. I assume the food was close to going bad so they salted it. We got food poisoning that night and we assume it was from the food."

- oyster shooters: great bloody mary mix, okay oysters
- zucchini fries: juicy and fresh, but limp with no crunch. I would pass on this next time
- Phoenix burger: a hint of heat, but otherwise meh. The bun is not a normal bun, but rather some sort of knotted bun that fell apart when I bit into it. It was definitely hard to eat. The meat was well-cooked though (hit right on med-rare). Truffle fries were thin and right on. They had perfect crunch
- flat iron steak: coworker enjoyed it, as well as the green bean and potato cake side
- lemontini: really tasty 

The bartenders were great. Jill and Mimi were fantastic company. This is a solid place for good conversation and decent food, but definitely not the best burger I've had. I will say it is a place with great value. During their reverse happy hour ($3 well drinks, $3 off appetizers, $5 burgers), our total came out to $60 before tip. That was for 2 oyster shooters, 3 drinks, zucchini fries, phoenix burger, 2 raw oysters, and the flat iron steak. Not bad!"

In case you haven't been to an arcade since the 80s, they now have cards onto which they load 30, 60 minutes etc. of play time. So you can leave the quarters at home! 

I've been here a few times for various events, and for my birthday last year after they sent me a deal for free gaming for up to 6 people for 30 minutes and a birthday treat from the restaurant for me! That worked out as I had visitors in town who were up for some free video gaming.

The board game selection is really great and often the management will come back and check out what we're playing and see how we like it. 

The only downside is the service can be pretty hit or miss. I'm not sure if this is because we normally sit in the back, but we often have to hunt someone down to make an order and sometimes the we'll get a dessert before our main! haha.

I came here on another occasion when it was slower. My BF and I were playing a game and a lady approached and set her child down on the game next to us. He started crawling over to get to our game.. He even picked up our balls and while playing this fast paced game I hit him with my elbow. Complete accident. I did not think this lady was partially challenged enough to allow her child to run wild. I told her to move her child or it'll happen again, he's not my responsibility. She threw back some shade, so I told her to learn to be a mother. Later my BF and I are at the bar and he is standing next to me. The lady came by as if she was about to exit. She took her styrofoam cup and threw her drink on my BF. I got up and threatened her damn life. We called management and he had said she is here almost everyday and let's her kid run around and he felt too bad to kick her out. Mind you, she isn't paying to play ANYTHING. End of story, he comped us some games and the bartender was cool enough to comp us a drink. Well, I'm here right now and she's still here doing the same thing. So if you're homeless or broke feel free to lurk around here and not spend money. Oh and bring all your kids so they feel bad and let you stay!"

Made no appointments as it was not busy when we arrived.  Called just in case to see if we needed to make an reservation but they said no need as it generally gets busy later in the evening, and they were right.  Once we sat there for a good 10 mins, we noticed people started to come in, one by one.  

Server were alright, it would be nice if  they described which taco was which, as we ordered 3 different tacos and could barely tell the difference.  

We got the churrizo corn dog as the appetizers, it was alright, kind of blend, the hint of spice was good.  The tomatoe/corn sauce on top was a good touch to compensate the blend taste.  

We got 3 tacos, pulled pork, chicken, brisket.  I would say i was dissapointed,  tasted a bit blend as well.  I had high hopes for the taco wrap as the pictures on yelp made it look delicious, but tasted kind of like card board and tasted tough.  And I've had my fair share of real good tasting tacos.  Compared to when i went to dominican/cuba before.  I had high hopes itll somewhat taste the same or more or less at least a different twist.

And finally for drinks we got the carribana and the sunrise cocktail, did not end up finishing it but they were pretty good if you like the super boozy taste.  The carribana cocktail you can taste the hint of coconut and was a good level of sweetness, same goes with the sunrise.  It had a good puch taste and nice touch of slush ice for a hot sunny day.

Would i go back, probably not for a while."

It's very expensive but you can save a lot by purchasing time cards, this seems to be the way forward with any 'swipe card' location.

Machines at this location are generally quite new, however, games can be out of order for months! I have no idea what the techs get up to here, but it certainly isn't machine fixing! When I ask for help fixing a game, they just put my credit back on my card and avoid the problem. Emailing the manager gets results, but we shouldn't have to right?!

Food is pretty good actually, for bar food. Spending $15 can get you a 2 hour game card, so this is the way to go. They also have bowling and a gaming lounge, not my scene personally, but it's there!

I give this location a 2 out of 5 due to the price and poor machine fixing. I will alter my review of this gets sorted out in the future"

My boyfriend and I decided to try Charr- we walked into an empty dining area with only 2 people sitting at the bar. Figured we could have a quick bite and be in and out easily... Turns out not so much. The server looked like we had annoyed her by even being there. 30 minutes later, my pulled pork sandwich came out dry like it was sitting under the heat lamp for about 20 of those minutes. Mind you- we were literally 1 of 2 tables in the place. I attempted to just power through but the meat was so chewy and rubbery that it was unbearable. My boyfriends burger came out very well done after initially asking for it to be medium. He decided to send his back to the kitchen only to be given an eye roll from the server and uncomfortable stares from the kitchen staff (the kitchen is open to the dining area). About 10 minutes later the burger came back out to only be cooked ""well"" again. My boyfriend decided to just eat it this time and found it to be tough and tasteless.To make a long story short- every single staff member we had the privilege of being in contact with there made us feel as if we were annoying them from start to finish. I will never recommend this place to anyone and will not be going back. It makes so much sense as to why I never really see many people in the restaurant from the street.

Next, we asked the bartender if there were any happy hour specials and all he said was they has no good specials. He never told us what they were.  My friend ordered spaghetti with meat sauce and I ordered manicotti. To say his spaghetti needed more sauce was an understatement. We literally counted about four pieces of meat in the entire dish. He had to ask three different people for extra sauce before he actually got any. For $13, I got two tubes of manicotti. I honestly mean this and I'm not trying to disparage the place but I could've bought frozen manicotti and dumped ragu on it and it would have tasted just as good. And $5.35 for a draft Peroni is too much. I think boxed spaghetti with Ragu would've been better than what my friend had. It's a shame because I used to really like this place.

I think that there could be more games (there was a pretty large, and empty, dining area), but it was clean, well maintained, and the games they had were quite entertaining. The Pac Man air hockey game was a big hit! Although they don't have a DJ and dance floor like they do at Insert Coins, this was still a good time.

I also liked that they had a full bar with drinks that weren't overpriced. The bowling alley also looked very intriguing, but alas, we didn't have an opportunity to bowl on this occasion. 

I think that this is a great option for kids and adults alike! Game On!"

I hate to give out bad reviews, and I rarely do. But this place is not good. 

2 stars for the cool atmosphere. 

Food???? Marinara Sauce that is way to peppery and clunky. Moscow Mule from a mix? and then poured into a stainless steel mug? Never heard of such a thing. (Moscow mules are known for their copper mugs)

I got the parmesan tator tots. I almost laughed my tail off! Frozen tator tots sprinkled with parmesan cheese.

Our Halibat had zero taste, no seasoning, just a slab of fish. 

Think these guys are missing the boat on the food, the atmosphere is nice, but that's about it."

Some of the items are true winners.  The guacamole is first class, with the Cremoso Jalapeño cheese dip.

The tacos are also mostly good.  I could use a little more fish in the fish taco but all very tasty.
I had the Rock Lobster, Fish, Beef, Chicken were all excellent.

Fried Avocado was not a winner for me.

The sweets are also very good.  Citrus Margarita bars was my favorite, and the Churros were good but the dough is to soft and is hard to dip into the sauces without breaking apart.

We got a great deal with a Groupon for all day game play.  The arcade portion is smaller in floor space than other arcades we have been to, and this created a bit of congestion at times.  There is also a bowling alley and a couple of pool tables.

We ate dinner at the on-site restaurant.  We were a little put off by the initial customer service experience of being seated.  We almost didn't eat here.

The restaurant was loud because of the arcade, there were lots of television playing sports.

The waitstaff was friendly.  We found the food to be good, portion size was large, and the quality was good.  I thought the prices were reasonable for the quality and amount of food we got.

I'm not sure if I would eat here again, but I would definitely take the kids here again with a Groupon."

I noticed a few games were straight-up imports from Japan, and other games that I had never seen anywhere else, such as Kung-Fu Panda (so much fun), Transformers and Mario Kart.  There's the usual skee-ball, and some air hockey games as well.  I paid an absurd amount of $ for Baby C to get candy and some water gun made in Taiwan, but that's not the point.  The point is 90 minutes went by pretty quickly, and Baby C was totally entertained.  Not entirely happy about paying a deposit for a card, since I gave it back to GameWorks at the end of the day.

This most recent visit, the hostess seated us and I asked for a reminder on what the WiFi password was (I'm not a total douche...my wife and I run a small biz together and commonly work over meals and drinks).  The hostess kinda curtly said she didn't know if the place even has WiFi (I knew it did) and didn't know the password if it did.   No effort to go get it.  Finally waited for a server, who vaguely thought she knew it.  I'm not in the HRM industry, except as a consumer, but I can't imagine not training my staff on this.  Love the ambiance and food.

Heartache of heartaches, THEY HAVE CHANGED THEIR FALAFEL recipe.

REST IN POWER FALAFEL PATTY.

Still love the place as always. They've got a rotation of new lovely servers and service has gone up just enough for me to not find any issues. Yes, it's still a little slow at times, but I was there for over 3 hours sipping away and studying and I was impressed that I was checked up on a few times (huge difference from before.) The one server who had given me a touch of attitude is now gone and it's softened the vibe visibly. 

It was really lively on the Sunday afternoon I visited, a huge ASL group took up the front space signing away with vigor, to the right of me, a nuclear family quietly enjoyed tea, while university students kept the back jumping.

The company is always adding new games.  Last time I went there (last week), I found a new Kung Fu Panda game which was ridiculously fun.  

There's a pretty good computer/lan center that hosts video game and computer game tournaments.  I'm pretty sure they do Hearthstone tournaments every other Sunday.

The one thing I'm still wondering is when I signed up for ""four free hours"" of computer time during the midnight League of Legends of event, I never received those free hours the next time I came back.  

Other than that, there are a good amount of games to win tickets and the prizes are great if you have a kid.  I've already won a giant care bear for my daughter.

Finally, almost forgot, there is bowling.  I believe there were 8 lanes.  The games are not expensive and you can order food there.

But I have a difficult time when places are blatantly being cheap and cheating children and families.  

Specifically, I'm referring to their Wizard of Oz machine which is one of those coin dozer type games where you knock coins down.  This game was fun to us at first b/c it has cards that you can collect and if you manage to gather them all, you can turn them in for a ticket bonus of like 2000 tickets.  So I learn that the Toto dog card is the rarest of the bunch and there are only a few in each machine.  And obviously you need this card to complete the set and the ticket bonus.  Well obviously they are aware of this too b/c they literally have all of the Toto cards out of play.  How do I know this?  Because they are stupid enough to put them in the machines at the very top of the decks so that you can see that they are in there.  But the cards fall from the bottom and somehow the Toto card is always on top.  Not 1. Not 2. But 3 in plain view and out of play.  I have been in and out of there for over 6 months and just check as I walk by and they are still right there on top.  

I would never accuse a place of being shady or trying to scam people without being sure... but I think 6 months straight is a fair amount of time to base my accusations.  I have pictures as proof on my other phone.  Who knows what other games they have rigged that aren't so obvious.  It's sad really that a business would be so cheap when it comes to winning a relatively small amount of tickets used to buy mostly junk toys.

Shame on Gameworks for taking a game that is expensive to play anyways and feeling the need to cheat children and families.  

I'm taking my business to other places.  John's Incredible Pizza is a very good alternative for those that don't like to support shady businesses."

The prices are high, the games race car and shooter centric. The kids had a blast running around and playing the games. The Pac-Man air hockey was definitely the crowd favorite though. A mix between hungry hungry hippos and air hockey made for a hectic scavenging mess. It might lead to someone getting a face full of pucks, but it is always worth it to crush your rivals. The fighter jet game in a pod was also quite fun. Otherwise, I tend to go back to the tennis game. 

Besides the central room; there is a bowling alley, gamer room with computers and gaming systems. I didn't eat, but their drinks are really reasonable. To get a Hendricks and soda or a Bulleit and ginger beer was $16. Maybe I am so used to paying Strip prices, but it just doesn't sound too bad."

The idea is fantastic, the menu sounded awesome, the reviews were in general great. After a failed attempt at getting into Barroco, I remembered that I had seen great reviews for this place online and convinced my friends to give it a try.

We get in and the atmosphere was nice. It seemed laid-back, the waitresses and bartender were extremely nice and provided great service, and the seating area was well.. Ehh.. I don't know. Let me just say a little about the food.

I got a Korean Beef Bowl. I've had Korean beef from a Korean family. What I ate was not a Korean Beef Bowl. It was ground beef, sriracha, and rice. I'll give it to 'em though-- the rice was cooked well, and the beef had a good spice to it. It wasn't terrible, just not as flavorful as I had anticipated.. I enjoy rice.. I enjoy beef.. I enjoy Sriracha.. But I don't know.. It just wasn't quite up to par with anything I've had elsewhere. I also had a mixed drink.. It wasn't special, but it was good enough to get a buzz going. I again expected more flavor than was present. 

My friend got the Moroccan bowl.. It was rice, egg, some avocado, and a canned Mexican red salsa? He claims there was nothing Moroccan about it.. I'll take his word on it.

Now for the grand finale: my last friend got the Beef Ramen... Yeah... Ramen.. We immediately suspected that something had gone awry when they brought out a very tiny bowl.. Too tiny to house the typical ratio of broth to noodle that one would expect from a ramen dish. The beef was.. Well.. The same ground beef that was in my Korean beef bowl. The noodles.. Let's be honest, this was pretty much noodles with broth as an afterthought. 
I remember the look on his face when he took the first bite.. He looked like he was in pain. I had asked him if it was all right and he didn't even bother trying to lie. When he had finally given up and pushed the bowl to the side, I decided to try my mouth at this dish to see if it was as bad as he claimed.. It tasted like gravy with a consistency to match. The noodles were not fully cooked, but were mushy on the outside, almost as if they had been left sitting in cold water all night.. Fortunately the drink had put me in a good mood so we all got a nice laugh out of it.

My final verdict: 
Idea: 10/10
Execution: 4/10

The dishes are all great in theory, but the flavors need reworked. Definitely not too happy about the money that was spent. Sorry guys."

I love the tapas idea and they price the items accordingly. I got the bento box with fried cauliflower and veggie ramen. Bento box came out in a Styrofoam take out container which I thought was a bit odd. The ""dessert"" was chocolate chips, in a little plastic sauce container, also odd. Overall not bad, the Wasabi aoli was pretty good.

The ramen, overall, was pretty good. This actually came in a real bowl, but the bowl was pretty small. Would have been nice to have more soup, I mean that's the point of ramen right?? The noodles themselves were pretty reasonable cooked although not perfect. The flavor was pretty damn good, though beans in ramen was a little odd. 

My friend got one of the rice bowls, which was pretty good, although it did have a sort of odd flavor or spice to it.

The drinks were delicious though! Only good things to say there.

So I'll definitely be back, but won't hold my expectations very high. From reading other reviews, seems like the quality can be inconsistent. Not sure what's happening in their kitchen, but if they can get their consistency better then it has the potential to be great."

The atmosphere is laid back. The outdoor patio is awesome.  Nice view of the sky (sunset) and some trees for shading. Dogs welcome!!

The wait staff was very efficient and super nice.  Down to earth. Attentive. 

Our food was delicious.  Wasabi fires very tasty, not super hot - so don't be scared off.
Edamame beans?  I think that's what they were called. So very good and natural. Just the
right dusting of salt and spice. 
Skewered chicken and rice with roasted vegetables. Again, a wonderful blend of taste. 

I just stuck with the local beers.  But they had a list, I'll check out next time.  

Overall, it is not overly priced. Too many spots in Lakewood are getting hoyty-toyty and upper - crusted over. Know what I mean?  We just want a nice place to hang out with good food that isn't always typical bar food. And decent beer prices with a choice if we want something better than average. 

There was also a DJ. Not sure what type of music is usually played. But it was a little to hard for me - no metal please."

Mimosa came with some bubbling black item in the glass. Then my plate had black debris on it also so I decided not to eat. Then when my party ordered and I said I would pass the big ass waitress rolled her eyes and gave me an attitude as if I did something wrong. She needs some manners or a good old fashioned ass kicking. Either way they just lost 6 customers for good. No food is worth eating if on dirty dishes and no place is worth going if the staff is rude."

When they called me about the bowling party (it took a few times for us to finally get in touch) they asked me to pick two colors for party decor. 3 days before the party, they ask if we want to add any other guests or party platters.

The party was $25/kid and included 90 minutes of bowling, shoe rental, party decor, pizza, cookies, & soft drinks. Each person who RSVPd also got a one hour game card that they could start whenever they wanted, as long as it was the day of the party. 

There was a lot of seating & tables for all of the guests. There was even a separate table for presents. Our party of ~20 kids got 3 lanes to bowl. The food that came with the package was good enough for the kids + a few parents. The only extra food we ordered were nachos. 

Ebony was our server and she was so patient and friendly with our big group of 8-11 year olds. 

A few things you should know:
The party does not come with invites; however the manager Janai sent me their logo to work with for some 'DIY' invites.
Their goodie bags are very pricey at $5/kid, but again, Janai kindly let us bring our own. 

Overall, the experience was a fun one and I wouldn't have booked anywhere else this year."

Someone in an alcove was singing along to her guitar when we arrived. It was magical. 

We were told that we could explore the space and make ourselves comfortable wherever we liked. The owner came by and spent quite a while telling us about how he prepared his Bam Bam Chai, his ice teas, how he got the idea for Bampot. 

The curry we ordered was delicious. It tasted quite wholesome. I was surprised by how good the iced green tea was. It had a light lychee flavour (?) which made the tea perfect for summer.

Bampot also has a selection of boardgames which you can play at 1 boardgame for $3 (if you order a main). 

The only downside here is the wait for food. It's definitely not the place to go to if you're in a rush. 

Overall, it has a really special ambiance. Would definitely recommend checking it out if you're into teas and relaxing spaces with a Bohemian vibe."

Brick House is airy and rustic inside with a wood burning fire pit. We came at lunch and it was not busy. All of us opted for iced tea and we had a round on the table within seconds. The house salads were fresh and crispy...honey mustard dressing a bit sweet for my tastes. With just 2/3rds of a glass of iced tea our server asked if we wanted refills...we brushed him off and kept talking. I ordered the blackened mahi sandwich with fries. My colleagues both had the daily special chicken pot pie. As we waited another full round of iced tea arrived. We muttered our acceptances. The mahi was especially juicy and flavorful. In fact I hadn't had such a good piece of fish in this area. The pot pies were flaky and large, nearly 8 inches across with chunks of chicken breast, potatoes and carrots...this was savory goodness. Another round of iced teas arrived and I finally yielded, excusing myself to the restroom. The fries are seasoned well and plentiful...I felt like we got our monies worth for such a decent fish sandwich. As we prepared to pay the check, yet another round of iced teas arrives....this time in to-go cups! Good god man, apparently they need to get rid of this batch of iced tea!! Lol

Overall very tasty dishes with good service...will come again and perhaps drink beer next time."

The nachos came out at a decent time but the rolls came out after we were about finished eating. We had to wait another 20 mins for the waiter to get back with our bill so we could leave.

Just an FYI, the fries come with your burger and other sides come with the meal, so kudos to them for listening to the previous gripes and addressing them. 

I have been twice. I will be back again. It is a nice date spot, great dim atmosphere with some music, but you are able to carry on a conversation with ease.  And, like I noted before: lack of children.  The few I have seen were all well behaved and parentally managed.  The service was great both times, friendly, knowledgeable and attentive without hovering.

Give it a try and you may discover a new jewel of an eatery!"

I have to admit that I live and work in the area, so I tend to stay away from it during prime tourist/jazz festival season since I can enjoy the restaurant at any time of the year.  While I can't comment on their food or service when they're running at full tilt, I would say it's not to be missed in the fall, winter, or even spring.  My experience has always been excellent and although the menu isn't inexpensive, I don't find that it's overly expensive for the quality of food and service that you receive.  Add the fact that it's a non profit and all the proceeds go to funding our amazing Jazz Festival every year, and it's a no brainer choice for a lovely meal in the Quartier des Spectacles."

We originally bought 2 cards with $20 on them. After 10 minutes I realized they would be out of money real quick SO I inquired on the food and play option ($15 for an hour with one food item or $22 for 2 hrs and one food item) . You have to order select food, pay and then you can get your card. We were not hungry but since they wouldn't just sell me a card for the time, I ordered a pizza to go and brought it out to my car. With the hour/ 2 hour card it is simply good for playing. You do not collect ""tickets"" or points. I wish they would simply offer time ( no points) or per credit ( tickets earned) without having to order food. 
The ""prizes"" are ok. I like that you can save the card and continue to save the points."

This place is quite small, I was expecting something larger.  From reading the reviews, they obviously don't care about fixing their games.

We're so happy it took the place of Bonnie & Clyde's--which was smelly, dark, and overall not a place I ever wanted to be unless I was inebriated already. But Yuzu is a completely different vibe. 

Lots of seating, both bar space and a dining room, nice lighting (not too dark), and the music was at the perfect volume (perfect for having conversations without having to yell). Basically, it's a great place to come have a few drinks and sit and talk with friends. Definitely not the kind of bar to get wasted at (checkout the bar next door for that).  

As for the drinks, Yuzu really gets it right! The cocktail menu is extensive and we had a really hard time deciding what to try. We ended up going with 3 am Snap Stories, Florida Georgia Lime, and Gojira. Totally recommend all of them, but my favorite was 3 am Snap Stories. It's a tropical drink and perfect for summer. Everything was priced really well, not too expensive for craft cocktails. 

Didn't try any food but we plan to go back and change that. Someone next to us got the fries which looked and smelled so good. And everything else we saw coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled good as well. 

The bar staff was really friendly and very attentive. They were really helpful when we had questions about the drinks. Our favorite bartender from B&C's was there serving too, which was cool. 

If you're looking for a place in Lakewood to have some good food, drinks, and chill with friends then definitely check out Yuzu!"

First off, let me start off with the arcade game selection. Not much of a looker. Compared to the old GameWorks, the selection is a fraction of what used to be and half the games weren't functioning correctly either. Also the useless bar/restaurant area composes half of this GameWorks. That's right, they put more effort into building an eatery rather than getting decent GAMES. The E-Sports arena was pretty decent and the bowling area looked cool as well.

Be prepared to spend at least $20+ if you wish to have a decent experience as the GameWorks cards no longer work by hours. They work by a points system instead and the games range between 4-11 points. Overall, these guys need improvement if they wish to retain their former glory."

I had seen the hype video on BlogTO, but it did not deliver. The patio was full when we arrived, so we took a seat near the front of the restaurant (not a problem). The server we were assigned was also the bartender so it took forever to get our orders. I had to get up from my seat and walk over to the bar to ask for cutlery and plates because the staff were too busy standing around and chatting with one another. Our 'server' didn't stop by once to ask how our meal was and we had to get up to request our bill. Food was pretty decent, but never again."

I like that it is located pretty close to my home and that it's open 24 hours because I'm usually getting off pretty late every night.

I like that they have a bell to ring outside so the employees can buzz you in at night. I think this is a great safety precaution for any 24 hour business and its nice to know the owner cares about their staff.

I do not like that they are always out of stuff when I come after 9PM. It is always stuff I'm really craving too! Like pickles, or avocados, or tuna. I definitely think for a location that has to be open 24 hours they should stock better and help set their employees up for a successful night.

Over all not the worst Subway I have ever been too. Employees are always tired by the time I get there, but they are friendly!"

Very chill atmosphere and the moroccon mint tea I had was lovely. They have an extensive tea list so there is sure to be something for everyone. My date had a salad which he said was fine and I had the daily curry which was a lentil sweet potato curry. The curry was decent but the pita that it came with was the star for me, it was chewy with raisins that was a sweet contrast to the curry. Overall, I really liked the atmosphere and after 9ish it started getting quite packed. I would definitely come back for a visit!"

We really liked the low-key atmosphere complete with fireplace, a dozen flat screens, recliners and tables that used super-comfy love seats as their booths. It was rather quiet on Sunday evening, and we enjoyed relaxing at our tables -- it kind of make waiting for food easier. Service was just fine, and I appreciated that my waitress made sure to bring me another water when mine was gone, even though she was carrying another table's food in her hands as well. We got the Sweet n Sour Tails for an appetizer and while they reminded us of a similar dish at Red Lobster that we like, they were really nicely done -- not too hot, but the heat could be adjusted by eating the fried jalapenos for those who like it hot. I chose the special of the day, the Mahi Mahi fishsticks with fries and fruit salad. Boyfriend chose the pork chops and mashed potatoes. Everything was really good -- it's one of the few times I've heard my boyfriend say that everything in his meal was good (and we've been together for 9 years, so that's saying something). And I really enjoyed my fishsticks -- they were high quality and yummy. Even the fruit salad had some extra care put into it with strawberries, watermelon, mint and grilled peaches. I'd definitely like to come back here again, and from the looks of their drinks menu, that'll be one of the things that I'd like to try next. :)"

There were so many people in there you had to wait to get a turn on most games. This was Sat. at 4:00 p.m.-5:30. This place is just prepping young kids to throw away their money in hopes of hitting the 500 ticket pay out! Sound like Vegas to you?  They serve alcohol, that's a plus! They have a few bowling lanes, and kids loved that! At least they played something. They also have a small video game room with some game system for older kids. I didn't check that out much, and have no idea how long that's been there. The food is very good here. Plan on spending a lot of money if you take a few kids here at once. It's cheaper to purchase one or two large play cards than purchasing 5 different ones. So we got two and had the teens swipe for the 10 year olds.

It was pretty big for where it was located. There is a bar, restaurant, bowling lanes, a computer game room, and a tiny, tiny counter in front of the prize area. Not to mention a pretty large area of general games. 

Opening was fun. They had a little deal going on for $12 that was pretty sweet. 
Now, I know that a lot of little kiddies come to TS to play and such, but the kind of games that were there...it was a little disappointing. I expected way better games and a better variety. Of course, some games were closed because they weren't giving out prizes or tickets at opening, but that was to be expected given the foot traffic they got. Though, I thought they would at least have a small raffle or something~! 

Some of the best things that were there were the shooting games, racing games, the virtual reality roller coaster pod, and the 4D Haunted House game!"

We got the Carolina Burger and the garlic knot bun was a great idea. The burger was juicy and delicious. The truffle fries were the perfect side for it as well. Anything truffle I'm a sucker for.

Last night we went again after a few months and it seems they forgot the butter and garlic on the buns and the truffle on the fries. The burger was pretty dry due to the dry bun and lack of any garlic and butter so it was just a knot bun really. 

Not sure if it was a bad night, but if I truly hope they pick up the quality again because I want them to succeed here.

I'll give it one more shot and if it's good again, I'll be happy to update this review with 5 stars that I would've given it a few months ago when I first ate here."

I had passed this shopping center on Thunderbird numerous times and wondered what the *&&^% was in there.  Now I know.

The restaurant cuisine is modern American.  What I mean to say is that the food is basic American fare with a twist.  

The restaurant has delicious hamburgers...........hence the name  - Charr.  The presentation is also modern as is the restaurant.  I rather enjoyed the Caesar's salad with REAL anchovies and a hamburger with REAL Swiss cheese and crimini mushrooms - yum!  My little one had the mac and cheese that was creamy and done perfectly.  My wife had the turkey burger which was juicy, not dry.

Our server was delightful and had a great sense of humor and was real likeable in general.  I would opt to say that the food is on a five star level.  However, the time to fill the order and receive the food must have been close to one half hour.  I was especially cognizant of the time since I have a seven year old that was hungry and making every minute after ordering count.

My advise to Charr, perfect the order time and you have a winner.

The restaurant offers many daily specials, including hamburgers.  Try it out!"

We started with delicious,well made Sweet Thai Chicken Sandwiches and the crispy, chicken Tenders as well. The meal took a little while to be served but the service was great. While waiting we realized that the television was uncomfortable to watch at times because the contrast was WAY too high.

After our meal we bought game cards. First, we had to buy a new card that was $2 and then the actual credits range from ($5-$50) and then if you want to supersize the amount of credits you get, that's an extra $2 dollars as well. The prices of the credits weren't too bad but to actually enjoy yourself, you have to spend at least $20 due to how much credits each game takes. Overall GameWorks is SUPER fun and I'll definitely be back."

The bar was not busy in the least bit and there were 4 people working behind the bar. It took 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us. After that, another 5 minutes to take our drink orders. After we ordered, we watch the bartender as he scrambled to figure out where everything was. Our drinks were simple, not fancy at all, one vodka soda and a whiskey coke. After looking for a couple of minutes, he comes back and tells me that they're out of the vodka I wanted, so I quickly picked another. He took about 4 minutes to make each drink. After sitting for 30 minutes at a half empty bar, we finally got our drinks. If this is the way the service will go, we will not be returning and I'm sure it will not create any repeat customers."

The food provided was excellent--we had a range from Pizza, wings, mini pretzels, tortilla chips, jalepeno poppers and mini sliders (which I kept coming back for, haha.) Our hosts were amazing! I forgot their names sadly (I swear one was named Lorenzo?) but the female hostess with the purple hair was extremely sweet and helpful and our male server was funny and cool as well! GW provided us free game cards and a 2 hour play card but this is a place where you get tired out at easily depending on what game you play (or what you're doing overall), so I only did a couple rounds of DDR. Noting from other reviewers, the games mostly seemed to be back in working condition, so I suppose they recently fixed everything? The only disappointment was the E-sports looked lacking (again, the time and day could have contributed to that.) Would I be back? Probably not because it is QUITE a distance from my place of residence but for special occasions, absolutely.

PROS:
+SEATING: Comfy, somewhat spacious. The have little seating areas with pillows that look really comfortable to play board games in.

CONS: 
- FOOD: My spicy peanut soup was neither spicy nor soup-y. It was basically rice with vegetables and some peanut sauce drenched on the rice. So disappointing. I also didn't order a salad, but was happy because I thought it came with my $9 meal. I learned afterwards that they made a mistake which I realized at the cashier. Reluctantly, the cashier took the salad charge off my bill but she made the most horrendous gestures. 

She slammed the interact machine in my face and ultimately did not look pleased. Even if she wasn't being the best cashier, there's something called BASIC HUMAN FUCKING DECENCY. So rude. 

The food selection is both limiting and ultimately disappointing. The pita bread was yummy though, and sweet, but not worth $9 as part of any entree set. Looking at my friends' meals all around, nothing truly appealed to me. 

Ultimately, I recommend Bampot if you're a tea connoisseur. If not, go somewhere else where your consumerism is more valued."

Sadly, it just all went wrong.  My wife and I just grabbed a spot at the bar early on a Friday afternoon.  Not too busy at all, early dinner and drinks.  Keep in mind, we are sitting right ""In the Middle of the Bar"".  Took us what seemed like 5+ mins to get our first drink.  Were then waiting another 5+ mins before we were asked if we would like to order food.  Ok, definitely could have flagged a bartender down for attention if I wanted, but for a first visit was just seeing how the service truly was.  So already, we are off to a bad start.

Our order was to split the Sliders on Mini Garlic Knots, the 5-cheese Melt and order of fries.

1) Sliders were dry and very overcooked.  Was missing the Chipotle mayo and the buns seemed not fresh and too dense with absolutely no Garlic flavor.  Sorry, if you are a burger joint and you put sliders on the menu, they better be damn good.

2) Five Cheese Melt was......incredibly flavorless.  We didn't even finish.  I was shocked.  5 cheeses an grilled sourdough!!!  How is it possible that it could be flavoress?  5 CHEESES! 

3) French Fries are the only reason it's not a 1 Star review.  They are really good.  Not the best ever or ground breaking, but still very crisp and delicious.  Their is no way in hell they are worth $6, but they are still good.

My wife and I promised we would give them one more shot and this time be more vocal if needed.  We really want Charr to work out but if the food and service remains the same, our next visit will sadly be our last."

My friend had the brisket and shrimp tacos and said both were quite meh, small and simple. I'm not sure I would go back because it's out of the way and there are much better Mexican spots in the city."

I live fairly close to Brick House and typically dine here at least a few times a month. I have been here on dates, with large groups, with clients and with friends. I always enjoy what I order and out of all of my visits I have never, ever had a bad meal or inadequate service. In fact it has always been quite the opposite. The servers have always been attentive and the general manager nearly always stops by to make sure everything is satisfactory. On my most recent visit I had a longer than normal conversation with him and he seems like he is a genuinely nice guy who takes pride in his restaurant and truly cares about the experience his patrons receive.

I have only been going to Brick House for a couple of years and am always surprised when I mention it to people and they think it is another ""breastaurant,"" akin to Hooters or Tilted Kilt. At least for the couple years I have been going, this is no longer the case. The servers all wear shirts that are not overly low-cut and that go all the way down to their pants without a bare midriff. I do think the servers are collectively younger than than a lot of restaurants but they have always been friendly, show enthusiasm for the menu and do a great job!

The décor of Brick House Tavern + Tap is very unique. They have many normal booths and tables but also have a few tables with couches as the seats on either side. They have a few large recliners with table inserts that you can sit at that are positioned in front of large TVs. There are easily 50 TVs around the whole dining area that are positioned in a way where you can see many different ones from wherever you sit. However it also seems that they are not too intrusive and allow one to easily ignore them and focus on who they are dining with. In the winter I often try to get a table near their large open fireplace in the center of the dining room! They also have a large patio with multiple TVs and fireplaces on it.

I think their food is pretty unique as well. They have some really good appetizers that are plenty large enough to share. Their dinner portions provide plenty of food to where I often find myself bringing part of it home with me. Everything seems to be priced very reasonably too.

If you have yet to try Brick House Tavern + Tap I recommend that you add it to your list. If you visited back when it was filled with scantily clad servers maybe visit again now to see the differences. Overall I think it is a fun restaurant with many menu options that should satisfy anyone wanting to eat!"

My boyfriend and I were not greeted by anyone and stood at the door for a little bit. The atmosphere is cool and updated. We chose to sit on the couches. We had a male server which seemed to care less and wasn't too friendly. I chose the ribeye which is a special on Tuesdays. It was suppose to be 12 oz but more like 6 oz. It was ALL fat. I told my server and the manager came to the table. All she had to say it the ribeye is a fatty cut of meat. I didn't want to spend $18 on a steak made of fat. Save your money folks. This place isn't anything special and food is MEDIOCRE. I will not return. Manager wasn't very understanding. I didn't even want a discount. I just wanted her to be aware. I work in the food industry and I'm a server. This place needs improvement. Only thing it has going for it is the cool design. Cook at home folks."

Well, maybe I didn't cross it specifically to be my #100, but I'm in Toronto and it happened to be my #100. Now, I was worried that my excitement regarding this restaurant may have been biased. I was REALLY excited that this place was going to be the big triple digit review. However, this place was pretty fantastic. 

The ambiance here is great. Just enough tables to feel like it could be crowded, but not too many to were it loses its intimacy. Great long padded bench with tables spread out along it and some individual tables  as well. A cute little outside area (but only 2 person tables can fit...it is teany tiny!). Nice well decor, lighting, music. Cute bar with tons of wine options (or at least enough to make me happy). 

Food was pretty great too. The bread was hot and toasted just right and served with olive oil and balsamic. My pasta with sausage was great and my friend enjoyed her mussels. However, it was the frites that came along with the mussels that were pretty damn delicious. Great salty flavor with what seemed like a hint of parmesan and spice. Finish off with a perfect sized tiramisu and you'll be pleasantly satisfied. 

My sangria was great, but I don't claim to be a sangria expert (one of my favorite sangria's is made with Mad Dog 20-20...I love Dominik's!). Very fruity and I loved it. 

A couple of fun facts: All you can eat mussels Mon-Thu; They have a second location apparently but I have no clue where it is; It's been around for about 8 years (per our waiter, who was very nice) and is a local favorite; packed on weekends and they don't take reservations between 7pm-8pm on weekends; they also have a prix fixe menu for $25 (appetizer, main course, and dessert) .

Honestly, this place would be great for a casual dinner with friends or even for a date. I really enjoyed it and the food was faboo (yahoo!)

Happy #100 Yelp!"

I've been to Bampot 7 or 8 times now, and the service is consistently slow, aloof, and is dangerously bordering on bad. The most notable offences have been delivering tea with a TEN MINUTE delay to getting cups (with no staff to be found the entire time) and the incomprehensible water policy. Bampot staff won't get you water (in fact, they flat out refuse), and direct you instead to a water pitcher and glasses by the front desk. While this is okay in theory, it becomes a disaster in practice because the pitcher is always empty or there are no cups available. Mix this with the staff's propensity to disappear, and you're looking at long wait times to get water. If they want to continue this help yourself to water policy, they need a bigger pitcher or cooler and they need to be diligent about replacing cups. Aside from these two main problems, the staff do nothing to make you feel welcome and are actually quite rude. The food is also quite bad (e.g., poutine soup is waaaaay too salty), although the carrot cake and bits and bites are excellent. I wish they could get their service and food act together, because the potential here is high. Board games and tea selection are still great."

The chicken was not a fresh grilled breast. It tasted like a frozen, ""pre-grilled"", rubbery chicken breast. I was quite surprised at this, but the whole sandwich was just chewy and spongey. My salad was a little boring.

The service was good and our waitress was pleasant. 
I would probably go back and try something else, but for my first visit, the sandwich did not impress me."

At different times like 20 small pucks would slide down on the table and it was a blast seeing the kids faces light up with excitement! 
We got here a bit late so we didn't get to try the food, but looking at the pics on Yelp, I may just go back for lunch before we leave Vegas. The bar looked pretty cool as well had 2 pool tables in back, but I was with my kids and holding my littlest man man so no adult activities for daddy. Another cool thing about this place is they had a section with some of the classics, Pac Man, Donkey Kong, just to name a few.

I've seen the same bartender there everytime I go. 
He's African American with a goatie, sit in his section and order a Moscow Mule! 
I'm a connoisseur of Moscow Mules (lol) and he makes them better than Mandarin Oriental, Wynn, all the top places in Vegas who have them on their specialty menu. 
The perfect amount of alcohol to spice, taste incredible!

Came here on a rainy Saturday and this place could not be more perfect. It beats all the other board game cafes in the city. 

FOOD: We ordered the ballad salad, the shared snack plate and the homemade chai tea. I couldn't pick a favourite if you forced me. They have a huge, high quality tea menu and a good selection of foods and desserts.

Ballad Salad: garlicky, nutty, and fresh. It's a simple salad but the ginger garlic dressing is to die for. 

Sharing Plate: Nuts & Bolts, Cheese & Crackers, Hummus & Pita. All ingredients are high quality, fresh and simple. Very well done. 

Chai Tea: milky, spicy and sweet. Comes in a lovely clay pot and warms you up. 

ATMOSPHERE 
We sat on a raised platforms on pillows with our shoes off. Very unique, and great atmosphere for playing games. There are also regular tables if that's more your style. 

They have about 100+ board games and a large selection of books. We played Pandemic (the BEST 2 person game) & Mr. Jack."

The best word that comes to mind is cozy: this place is just so warm and cozy, and would be a great place to chill on a chilly fall or winter day. I came on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 4 other friends around 1 PM - it was pretty quiet when we first came in, but was a lot fuller when we left about 2 hours later. I love the decor in this place, there are so many colours and different pieces (carpets, curtains, tapestries, pillows) and it's so fun and eclectic, this place just has so much character. It is pretty accomodating for groups of various sizes, although I probably wouldn't come with a group larger than 5 or 6. We sat on some couches around a little coffee table, but it looked like most of the other seating areas were meant to fit groups of 2 or 3. I didn't actually look at the board game selection, but my group ended up playing one that I've never heard of before, so that was fun.

They have an extensive tea selection - I had the honey spice tea and it was kind of like a chai tea but a little bit sweeter and less cinnamon-y. I also had a salad and added a side of pita and hummus. The pita was so good, it was so thick and soft, and my only complaint here would be that there wasn't more. The salad was also pretty good, it had a lot of stuff in it like cashews and the vinagrette is house-made and very flavourful. Vegetarians will be happy to note that all the food options here are vegetarian and most are also vegan. My meal ended up being $18 after tax.

I can definitely see myself coming back here, even if it's just to chill and chat with some friends. I saw lots of small groups nestled in these little nooks all around the place, and some people had even brought knitting supplies with them. It looked so cozy!"

On the test night, you'd expect mistakes and working out the kinks. In our case, every aspect was just spot on. My eldest, the self styled expert on wings, pronounced Charr's Chili Glazed Wings the best she's ever had. My youngest, not a wing fan, devoured them. High praise from both ends of the spectrum.

Last night, spot on again. Burgers on large garlic knots are excellent, juicy and perfectly cooked. Wings...yep, perfect again. A couple of Leini'e Summer Shandy bottles, super cold and served in cold glasses by our excellent and friendly server Kevin (only his third day, and you'd never know. Great job Kevin!)

Really well done concept, great service and excellent food!"

Apparently, they could tell it was hurting more than it was helping & they've since dropped that angle in favor of a more homey family friendly bar/eatery. The christmas ale I had was great, our server Lauren was cheery, upbeat, knowledgeable about the menu, and super patient with us as we figured out what we wanted. We got a lot of appetizers & there were so much room for at least one of them to be not-so-good or messed up in some way, but everything we ate was really top notch bar food. The chicken bites were tender & moist & the sauces were great with them. My burger was enormous and was perfectly cooked. The Fish & chips were crispy & savory & the fries were fantastic, not to mention you can get regular fries, cajun fries, or garlic parmesan tater tots. The prices were all also totally reasonable for the portion size & quality. I was really impressed with this place. As far as sports bars go, it's as good as they come, IMO."

With that said, I thought I'd give Shomars a try, being that it was close, and I have the chicken pita before and liked. So, I ordered the Greek Salad with chicken and a side pf pita bread.  The chicken was cooked to perfection and the salad was good, very large too.  However, I found the dressing to be a little oily than what I prefer, but will definitely go back for the chicken pita again, love the tzatiki sauce!"

When I walked in it was a lot dingier than I remember. We had initially sat on a table, and then moved to one of the cushioned alcoves by the window because it looked cozy. Unfortunately, they were very dusty and even had hair balls scattered around (one of them stuck onto my friend's shoe that she had taken off and placed off to the side). It looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in a long time. After noticing the hairballs we moved to a table nearby that looked like it hadn't even been wiped down. My friend asked the waitress if she'd be kind enough to bring a wet towel for her to clean it with (she didn't even ask her to do it) and she came back and brought us paper napkins. 

When the waitress came to get our order we asked whether ice teas were available. She told us that any tea could be made into ""iced tea"". Other than that she didn't have much knowledge about the teas since she was new. We ordered the dreamsicle iced tea, blueberry tea, and earl grey tea with a splash of milk. For food we got the savoury platter ($17.50) and a side salad. 

I'll start with the tea. It was all very watered down. I've ordered the dreamsicle every time I've been to Bampot and it's never tasted like that before. The teapot wasn't even filled to the top. The blueberry tea tasted like water. As an avid tea drinker, I'm aware that fruit teas usually have a lighter taste but this had very little taste to it. My friend's earl grey tea tasted like (her words) ""tim horton's tea that had been left to sit out cold"". We were so upset that we had contemplated leaving but unfortunately had to wait for the food. The tea cups and teapots were also all chipped and didn't look like they were in good shape. 

When the food finally came out, the platter was a sad imitation of a cheese/hummus plate. I looked at the pictures on yelp and mine didn't look anything like those ones, not to mention it didn't even have grapes. For something that's nearly $20 you'd think they'd be nice to include a bit more than a couple morning rounds cut up, hummus, crackers, cubes of cheese, and ¼ of a cucumber. 

The washroom also smelled strongly of urine and there was no paper towels. 

Sadly, I won't be coming back. I used to love Bampot but now it's just one those places that has been left to new employees who don't seem to care."

Menu on a chalk board was quaint, but hard to follow. I felt pressure to decide when the waiter visited my table to explain the menu. Since I was dining alone, the drink selection was limited. (Maybe if I ordered a bottle of something, but I only wanted a glass.) 

I began the meal with a complimentary Bruchetta on Crusted Bread. The tomato and olive oil was so fresh. I then ordered the Arugula Salad with Shaved Parmesan and a Balsamic Vinegar Reduction. Yum! Ate every bit. 

Then I ordered the Farfalle Pasta with Lamb Ragu. The portion was huge. Couldn't finish. It tasted very nice -- not out of this world, but still quite good. 

Only down side, the price. Meal for one with salad, drink and tip was over $50. For that price, I expected more. Probably won't return."

There was not enough newer games out on the floor and I can see that they are trying to copy Dave & Busters theme. A lot of dated machines and maybe they can add some pool tables in the dining area to give other options. I left a little underwhelmed and hope they do more with the space."

We moved in in December, and were optimistic that there were pizza/burger joints in walking distance. Upon trying the pizza, by our third visit/take out, we figured out that they have a one size fits all attitude that leaves much to be desired....bigger is not always better. It's a flavorless crust with greasier than necessary toppings. Then, we tried Charr, for burgers, since that's all they do, we were again hopeful that our burgers would be terrific. Such a pitiful excuse for a restaurant. First off, the server argued with my fiance about putting mustard on her turkey burger, and then neglected to honor my wish of medium for my burger. It was cooked all the way through, and the garlic knot bun is not a suitable vessel for the patty because it is too firm and crushed the toppings and it all squirts out. The service was so slow even though the place was almost empty during ""dinner rush."" The fries are really small, and too salty, sweet potato were also a disappointment. To top it off, this evening, my fiance was at home and could hear loud band/bad karaoke sounding music (which we have been hearing Thurs-Sat. since memorial wknd it seems) come blaring through our back yard starting 8pm. She traced it's origin to Charr, and asked to speak to the mgr. Joe Aiello (owner) fielded the complaint. He was a page out of Kitchen Nightmares, first arguing with her that as a business he didn't have to honor her request. When she suggested he turn it down or reposition the speakers, so as to keep the other possible neighborhood customers happy and returning, he insisted that as a bar that having this band as entertainment was beneficial. He called her rude for asking, and started to pressure her and intimidate her toward the door, trying to kick her out, he just cant take the criticism. This is not the kind of customer service you would expect to be given to someone who could bring in a lot of repeat sales. He is extremely unprofessional and it shows throughout his establishments. The food, service and ambiance in general is all sub par and reflective of his attitude toward guests and the Moon Valley community. NEGLIGENT! We highly recommend skipping this place, just head to McDonalds. We will not be back!"

I ordered a cake on Sept 22 for the 8"" strawberry meringue cake for pick up on Sept 27.  Ideally, I would like another email to confirm my order is ready for pick up other than the acknowledgement that my order was placed. Anyways, when I arrived on the 27 to get the cake, none of the staff there knew about it. I had to show them my order ( btw that was already paid by cc from their online order system). And they had to scramble for 5 minutes to ask other staff if they had my order.  One of them finally called the owner I guess to confirm that my order was placed.  Luckily, they had the cake available for me to pick up but that's only because they made a bunch to sell for their display case. If I had come later during the day I'm sure they wouldn't have the cake I wanted available.  Not only that,i had indicated on my order to write""happy birthday"" on the cake the staff said because of the cake I ordered, they couldn't write it on the cake and had to charge me an extra 50 cents to write it on a piece of chocolate.  ***Guess what, look at Nathan's Aug 19 2016 review, the cake he ordered they were able to write on the cake***

The hamburgers are great and they have the best onion rings I've ever tasted. No complaints about the service.
Nonetheless, our meal tonight was very uncomfortable. The owner paid for our meal and told us not to come back. 
The hamburgers now automatically come with truffle fries, which is a step in the right direction as they are a bit pricey. My niece wanted to know if she could substitute sweet potato fries and pay a little extra. The waitress indicated that this was not their policy. However, she would ask the owner indicatiing he would not like it. The owner came to our table asking what was wrong. So my niece asked again. The owner indicated we were getting the fries for free. My husband indicated that he does not eat fries so they would be wasted. My niece said matter of factly, ""So you don't make exceptions."" She did not say it in an accusatory mannter. This is when the owner's friendliness turned to hostility. He said that we would get everything we wanted on the house and added, ""Don't come back."" 
Maybe the owner had had enough complaints for the day. I don't think we were obnoxious. We were not asking for anything for free. We would have accepted, ""sorry no exceptions. We wouldn't have liked it, but it wouldn't have stopped us from coming back as the hamburgers are that good. 
The restaurant refused to take our money even though we expected to pay. (Ironically we were using a Groupon.)
I don't have complaints about the food or service; in fact I have recommended Charr to others who liked it. I am not advising anyone not to patronize Charr. The food is great, but the owner overreacted. We live in Sunnyslope and like to support local businesses. However, the owner made it very clear that he did not want or need our business."

A late kitchen for other industry workers is always a huge plus. The bar was busy, but my friend and I opted for a table, instead. A server came over right away to give us water and to greet us, but to also let us know that any orders we make, had to be made through the bar, which was fine and we understood because my friend and I are both servers and bartenders. We did not try any of the beers or cocktails.

My friend ordered the pork belly skewers, which he thought were great, and he also ordered ramen as an entree, which he told me was just okay. 

Having moved to Cleveland from Florida, I was very excited to see ceviche bowls offered on the menu for the spring and summer. I ordered the California ceviche bowl, which comes with white rice, avocado, scallions, tilapia, corn, and tomato salsa. I knew I was ordering cold fish and salsa with warm rice, but it just didn't meld well as expected and like other hot/cold combinations I had tried in the past. The rice seemed to have been sitting out for a while because it seemed to have gotten hard and crunchy. I didn't taste anything really stereotypically ""ceviche"" about the fish... no taste of lime or any citrus or any use of peppers, but I'll give it a pass because I still thought it tasted okay. 

What I had the biggest issue with, however, was the tomato salsa they used. It straight up tasted like marinara sauce poured over rice. I get that it was not listed as a spicy dish, but even a mild salsa has more taste than a standard marinara sauce. I looked longingly at the sriracha on the table and thought this dish would have tasted so much better omitting the tomato salsa and replacing it with sriracha, but alas, the damage was done.  

Overall, I'd come back to this place for the cocktails and to enjoy the very awesome atmosphere at the bar, but I don't think I'll be trying their food again."

I'm glad that Las Vegas is putting money back into places for kids and teens to enjoy and not just for adults. 

It's at a really easy location to get to and away from the busy hassle of the strip.

The old Gameworks on the strip was a great place but let's get real it was dying and had to be updated. I understand people's complaints about waiting and the lack of games but it's 2014 and we have to be realistic. 

And if your gonna be one of those people to complain about oh the lack of games cry about it.. I bet you only went to the old game works once or twice a year. If your going to be stuck up about it go try and find some where else with all the awesomeness build in one place.. And when you do please let me know..

Quite possibly the best laid-back atmosphere. Possibly biased because I'm a Texan (and this is a Texas-based company), but the service here is amazing, the food is pretty darn good, and the environment is awesome.

Jessica, my favorite waitress, is quite possibly the best server I've ever come across. It's like she's a freaking genie. I've set down half-empty cups, went back to reach for it again and find a full cup never realizing she had been there. Super attentive and the sweetest personality, she's the main reason I keep coming back again and again.

The food is good. A solid 'tavern-style' menu....lots of fried goods, finger foods, and even some decent more traditional entrees (which I honestly didn't expect). 

The pretzel sticks are a must as well as the sweet and spicy shrimp (deep fried hot peppers anyone?! LOVE them). Huge fan of the deep fried zucchini as well.

As far as main meals go, the salads suck. But let's be honest. You don't go to a place like this and order a darn salad. The mahi-mahi is shockingly good. Flaky, sweet, cooked perfectly. Goes great with cajun dusted fries. The burgers are all fantastic with the Black and Bleu being my absolute favorite.

I'm really looking forward to trying their ribs and their chicken&waffles on my next couple of trips!"

At the end of our meal we were surprised when they took care of our entire bill (all $110 of it!) We also identified ourselves when we made our reservations so they knew it was us from the start.

I think it is extremely commendable that the restaurant offered to make up for a previous experience. Most just wouldn't care.

With that disclaimer in mind: 

The service during this visit was impeccable. Despite the fact the restaurant was packed when we arrived we were greeted and seated right away. Throughout the evening we always felt like the most important guests in the restaurant with our food arriving quickly and our servers being careful to make sure we had everything we needed. 

The food is very simple and elegant. The ingredients are fresh. The menu is everything you'd expect from a nice Italian restaurant. My only advice would be to skip the Caesar salad, the other salads on the menu are much better.

While we ate our meal we watched Mariam, the owner, making the rounds of the restaurant making sure every table was happy with their experience. She is clearly passionate about what she does and has a real heart for her customers and her business. We couldn't help but overhear a truly genuine conversation between the couple next to us celebrating their 50th anniversary and Mariam. They were telling her how Alize is their favourite restaurant in the area. 

I'm giving this an honest 3 star review because for me, this isn't my ideal restaurant. I like restaurants that are a little darker, a little noisier, and foods that are a little more off beat and provide a 'wow' factor. 

This place will be lovely in the summer on the patio or even inside since they can open the front right up to let the warm summer breeze blow through.

Alize, thank you for a wonderful evening."

I had dinner here once and it was okay.  It is more pricey than other Chinese restaurants.  I usually just come here when I have a sweet tooth - They have a good selection of cakes.  I tried most of their cakes - Cheesecake, Mango cake, Chocolate Grand Marnier and Strawberry meringue are my favorite.  It is around $4.50 a slice of cake but the portion is not that big.  8"" meringue cake cost around $28 plus tax which is a little expensive."

The last time I've been here was when they had one on the strip next to M&M World.  I've seen nothing new except the bowling and they have billards.  It looked similar to Insert Coins.  Because they have a bar and gaming consoles for you to play on too.  I didn't like the new payment method where you have to get a prepaid card to swipe to play a game.  I like the old fashion pay with quarters.  I like they have an internet cafe where you can LAN party with your friends.  All in all, it's not that bad."

Good news first: the blackberry sangria is excellent.  I do prefer my drinks on the sweet side, and it tasted like candy.  

However, the rest of the food was very blah.  We ordered the bruschetta to share, but I'm not sure what we really got.  Cheese (I'm guessing a goat cheese ricotta) balls sitting in warm marinara sauce with sliced garlic bread on the side...since when is this bruschetta?  It wasn't bad, per se, but my tablemates and I were quite confused, to say the least.

Entrees were uneventful.  Lobster pasta special was bland, Pasta Weesie was greasy, etc etc.

Service was fairly laughable, though at least we got an apology when our ticket was ""lost"" in the kitchen and that was why we had to wait 20  minutes for our food."
"rqKCE0ASDODEd3IHlRI-OA","Cassandra","n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA","GameWorks","1","2014-10-01 00:00:00","Before I continue, I would like to say that this review is regarding only the arcade portion of this GameWorks. After hearing everyone's excitement about the new GameWorks opening up and seeing the sign posted inside of TownSquare for over a year, I thought this place was going to be spectacular. I was definitely let down. 

First of all, the space for the games is just too small. You could run through them all in just a couple of hours. That is, if you get a chance to play them at all. It's always crowded with so many people and sometimes you'll find parents just taking up the chairs for the games to watch their children play.

Second, not only are the cards/points extremely overpriced for an arcade but, the self help kiosks don't even work and when we went to inform the employees at the ticket counter, they just shrugged and said ""They never work"".

This brings me to another point, a lot of the games are ALREADY broken! Why pay so much money for all of these points if everything is shut down? Ridiculous.

Lastly, if your children play enough games to earn enough points for a certain prize that they want, don't let them get too excited. A couple of my friends spent just enough money to win enough tickets to get the LEGO pillow that they've been eyeing for a while. As soon as they reached the 1,500 ticket mark, they went to redeem their prize. Then, the employees told them they don't even have the LEGO pillows in stock. Though a few different colors of them were hanging on the walls.

I wish they could just open up a reasonably priced arcade. From now on, I'm sticking to the Pinball Hall of Fame."

Rule #2 Expect to wait for a game


So I've been here a few times and I'm a fan. I don't care much for kids so I know not to come during the weekend. I love playing video games and love to drink, I'm in heaven because this place has both. I can't say anything about the food because I've never had it. I can say that the service is either hit or miss, most of the bartenders are really really nice I've had 1 bartender a really pretty asian girl with a bad attitude but other than that I can't complain. I typically have a beer on draft and they are always very cold and the prices aren't bad. I always go for the Groupon special $20 for the all day pass because I could spend Hours playing games. Keep in mind that Game Works is not a big place so Yes you will have to wait for a game or two. This is a great place to come during the week and kill some time while having a few cold ones."

Ordered a ""glorified"" grilled cheese which literally was a hunk of cheese between two pieces of bread with no real flavor and my wife ordered a chicken sandwich that was dry and hard to eat.

The Showmars at the Government Center pretty much has a captive market due to it's location and lack of restaurants surrounding.  I came during an off lunch time, but you can see the remains of the lunch crowd that pretty much destroys the restaurant (figuratively speaking).  You walk in, and there is a sign that explicitly says to form 3 lines and the cashiers will call you went its your turn.

If you are walking to the building, you will have to go through metal detectors since the building is a secure location.  It's a little strange to feel like you need to go through security just to go to a restaurant, but hey, I get it.

Typical Showmars menu here...   items are made to order and are quickly to you after they give you a number tent and you find a table.  Since I came after the lunch rush the staff had closed of some table sections to clean, it was a little awkward when you got ""fenced in"" but easy enough to move a chair to go get a drink refill."

I signed up online for GameWorks rewards program a week before we left on our trip and received a free $10 game play in my email inbox (sweet)
My first impression of the new town square location was that the shopping center had plenty of parking and high end shops and out door play spaces for kids.
Inside the Facility seems much cleaner, and brighter than the old basement style location on the strip, that we had visited for years prior to it closing. 
This location seems much less busy right at the opening versus in the afternoon hours on the weekends.

The Party/Restaurant area:
We had drove from out of state to celebrated my oldest' s birthday here. Birthday parties have many options like: dedicated packages with your own room or u can reserve a table in the restaurant area. 
We chose a table and added balloons, Andre was our server. I remember this because he was just so friendly and attentive! I felt like we were his only party.. Which we were not! 
There was two other large groups having parties the same time. It was not bad thou.
There is no dedicated ""kids menu"". However we found the Pizza and GameWorks nachos are large enough for kids to share or for an adult as a meal. (The steak on the nachos was very tender and was flavorful.) Each of these seemed kid friendly and were a part of the Play and Eat combo menu (so you could have opted to get a 1 hour timed game card for about $2.99 more if you were coming outside a party package- plus $2 card activation if it's your first time getting a card). 
However the other menu items are mostly adult game day kind of foods or high end restaurant type meals, that would be great for a night watching sports/ or a girls night out. Not a lot of options small kids ( like hotdogs, mac and cheese etc.) I am usually an avid ""Yelper"" and had been slightly concerned prior to our arrival, about food quality and service, due to some older reviewers. My mind was quickly changed! 
I had to talk with the chef in advance of ordering because of food allergies and he was very professional and reassuring.  He said they had a new menu starting presidents day with several new items ( like mac and cheese balls), and that the kitchen had changed a lot since opening ( which happens a lot now that I think about restaurants I frequent). He was right that things must have changed, because the quality far exceeded the reviews I had read. I had no problem getting food everyone could eat (despite allergies) and Andre refilled my drink 4 times in the 40 mins. we sat to eat.
       
Inside the Arcade:
Family friendly atmosphere; Plenty of room for our stroller. We even saw a few double strollers while we were there! The family bathroom has a koala changing station. However no place within this bathroom to toss a dirty diaper, other than the tiny hand towel basket? (Hopefully they invest in a solution in the future)
For kids of all ages; The game floor seems to consist of several ""zones"": Many large ride on/in games, A row of bloody shoot up games , Massive flashy ticket games, A ""eSports"" LAN room which is quiet, dark and filled with a gamers wildest dreams worth of P.Cs and gaming systems, and lastly the bowling ally ( which I will go into more detail on later).
GameWorks did not disappoint with more than enough things to keep everyone entertained for five amazing hours that just flew by.
We had so much fun on the floor with timed cards we returned on the 15th for a second day, to allow for time in the eSports room for my older boys.

eSports/ Bowling Alley:
I inquired about the package options here as well for his party next year, and decided that's what we will plan for, for next time because of the value and option of pc based games like Minecraft. 
While here they spent 2 hours playing diablo 3 and mine craft.
Overall all boys had to be dragged out in the end they were having such a good time, look forward to many visits in years to come!"

I really appreciate having not one but two vegan options -- and they were very accommodating, even bringing out an extra side of fries when we realized the (delicious!) sauce on the fries might not be vegan. And speaking of the fries -- they were so good! VERY hot which is just how you want fries to come out.

The meat was cooked perfectly, and I like how they give you one big, thick burger instead of two small ones. The pretzel bun was also good, but could have been pretzel-ier.

Most of the basketballs were gathered into one basketball stall. also the machines that are damaged keep taking the credits from the game card.

I definitely enjoy playing Skee Ball, air hockey, and other arcade games while having an adult beverage. It's like Chuck E. Cheese for adults, except there are also kids too. Because there are kids, you probably shouldn't try to get tanked here, but they don't create a distraction or prevent adults from having a good time. There's a solid variety of games for all tastes.

The food is equal to above average bar food, which is fine by my standards. The real reason for ordering food is so I can get the Dine & Play combo, the best deal by far. The combo lets you get certain entrees plus a one hour ($15.99) or two hour ($21.99) game card. I'd pay those prices merely for the card, so throwing in an entree on top makes the combo a great deal. It's much cheaper than paying the cash rate. The game card doesn't let you earn tickets, but you can still play most of the ticket games without earning. I don't care about winning a stuffed bear, so that's not a problem.

As if it wasn't disappointing enough-things have gotten WORSE.  If poor service, mediocre food, and high prices weren't enough to ruin a restaurant, they've gone and gotten the bright idea to have live...er...music...on Saturday night.  (I use the term ""music"" loosely because if that is music, then everyone who can YELL lyrics to a song in an off-tune is a musician.)  So now to add insult to injury they have ruined any ambiance they may have had.

The reviews here didnt seem all that great but we live close by and found a groupon for their wings and 4 drinks (beer, wine or mixed) for only $18! 

Wings = outstanding! The spicyness of the wings does build up and make it almost unbearably hot (to me) but the chili sauce they put on them is delish! 

Alcohol = we had a few of their drafts which were pretty good: Purple Hazed (something like that), Mission Lager, Sweaty Betty, and Four Peaks Kiltlifter, yummy!!

Staff: friendly and attentive; family owned i think? even the owner/ chef came up to us a couple times while we were at the bar to make sure the bartender was treating us well (his son apparantly) 

Atmosphere: upscale, romantic, really nice!! 

Prices: expensive if you don't come here for happy hour! We gave in and tried ""The Phoenix"" burger and it was amazing!!  It is expensive considering they don't include a side with your burger but the food is awesome and worth a try!"

The back patio is super cute and worth the trip alone, but their food is delicious to boot! Prices are very reasonable, and both the tacos and corn were just bursting with flavour (seriously, try the corn - you won't regret it). My only critiques are that the tortillas are quite thin and delicate, so it broke while eating and turned into a hot mess (a tasty hot mess), and that the menu is a bit small (no mole dishes, sadly).

Expect a cross between Chuck e Cheese & Dave and Buster's. A group of my friends came here after buying the Groupon deal for all day arcade play. 

The bar was such a nightmare. I was trying to buy a couple rounds of drinks for my group of friends (6 people) before heading over to the games, but we ended up only doing 1 round (took at least 20 to 30 minutes from ordering drinks to actually getting the bill paid for). There were so many people trying to flag down the bartenders for food/drinks but there was not enough of them to provider service. I could have easily spent $100 more had there been a bartender, but we just got frustrated and left. 

They had a good variety of games (ticket and non ticket), but the majority of them were broken. More often than not, one of the two controller would not work.  This place could be so much better if the management would maintain the games better and hire more bartenders."

Time: ~18:00 EST

I made an OpenTable reservation with my friend for 5:30 PM; my friend was running late, so I got to push the reservations until 6:00 PM.  When I entered the restaurant, the server knew right away that I was the one that made the reservation and quickly sat us.

The waiters and waitress was absolutely awesome.  They quickly brought us water and told us about the specials that they had that day.  I ordered the seafood fettucine and my frien had the prix-fixe menu (salad, 8 oz. steak, and chocolate cake for $25).  The fettucine was superb: surprisingly quite a lot of seafood and sauce in the noodles.  

I also ordered a white chocolate, blueberry strudel for dessert.  I enjoyed how the tangy taste of the bluberries compimented the white chocolate; however, sometimes, the white chocolate overpowered the blueberries and got a tad too sweet.

Ambiance was great.  Small little restaurant, but I loved it.  Wasn't really feeling for an eclectic, large restaurant; so this was absolutely perfect.

Overall though, great experience at Alize.  Will defintiely come back again!"

My teenage son  decided to go the gaming section which features online computer role playing. the price at 5 per hour seemed very reasonable.  Decided to have lunch at the restaurant. It is inside of Gameworks with open walls so you hear the machines and excitment of kids and adults. There are also multiple tv screens showing various sports programs. The food was pricy for the two items choose, buffalo chicken wrap and fish and chips $25 but it was a decent portion. Just enough to feed three, not so hungry, people. 
Overall the area was nice and clean. The bathrooms were clean also."

We ordered two pizzas, one pepperoni and one cheese.  
Still no plates & silverware.. My friend went behind one of the service stations and got us plates & silverware after our pizza had already gotten cold. 
Pizza was so-so , definitely undercooked and super greasy. Waited thirty minutes for a refill on drinks until we finally pulled a different server to refill them for us. 
Waited another 15-20 minutes for the check. After that was done, we waited for the game card while watching the waitress go to every single one of her other tables to chat and talk with her friends before we got our game card. . .

About the restaurant itself: 
-takes reservations on Open Table.  Sweet. 
-had reservations available on time on our arrival.   something to be said as many places don't! 
-nice outdoor patio 
-good ambiance and decorations

About the food:  
-crab cake appetizer was good. flaky, good flavors, good size for sharing (2 on the plate) 
-my cousin loved the truffle fries  (she actually took the leftover fries to go she liked them so much)
-I had the salmon burger.   The salmon was perfectly cooked.  I decided to forego the bun, it was delicious on its own.  I get that this is a ""burger joint"" so there's a theme, but it's great as a non-burger too (that's how i would order in the future) 
-My cousin had the BBQ burger.   MMM!!!  I had a few bites of it.  Now that's a burger!  Get it!
-The garlic knot buns are awesome!  
-The Moscow Mule was perfect!  Served in a copper mug, minty fresh, all I hoped for! 


My only grumble about this place was that the service was pretty slow.  We sat outside and it seemed like our waitress didn't know if we were in her section or not, though she was friendly.  It took about 10 minutes for anyone to greet us after we had been seated  The meal took about 2 hours to finish for the two of us.  Nevertheless, it was enjoyable!!  If you're up for a leisurely meal, definitely hit up Charr's."

They were giving out 2 free hour game cards with a purchase of a $12 card (54 credits) because they were experience problems, which is a nice gesture. By problems that meant that half of the games weren't working. I went to the MGM location when it was open and honestly this location doesn't even come close. There are very little games and it doesn't help that most of them were down and the area is really small. Staff is very nice though. Their systems went completely down around 9:30pm and that's when my boyfriend and I decided to leave. 

What this Gameworks has that the old one didn't is an Esports area where you can play PC games like League of Legends and World of Warcraft. I get the concept of this idea, but you can stay home and play these games and this space could've been utilized for more games. 

I'll give this place another chance when they've had time to straighten out their kinks."

But they oepened at Town Square a few decades later...now, I feel ancient.

The initial scent of sweaty gym socks and piss as soon as you walk in only lasts about 5 minutes then, you get used to the smell. To the left, is an area where you can pick out your prize and to the right is a virtual gaming room for those who love PC games. Straight ahead are arcade games, circus games, simulators, Air Hockey, photo booth, etc. To the right and towards the back are private rooms for events and parties. At the very back is the bar/restaurant.

I've been here for a work function and so, we were in a private room. I was pleasantly surprised by the food they served us: chicken marsala, salads, braised beef with veggies, and funnel cakes. They also had more items on the menu. I was expecting pizza, fries, nachos, hotdogs and other junk. We had 2-hour game cards - those don't work on games that could instantly win you a prize (like those machines with claws that grab a toy) and the photobooth. Your time starts dwindling down as soon as you use it.

I felt the need to re-live my youth and play games that I loved as a kid: Street Fighter (hadouken! Tiger uppercut! Sonic boom! Face bite! Helicopter kick!), Air Hockey, DDR and of course, Super Shot - that basketball shooting game. I would spend hours playing Super Shot...that has not changed the few times I've been to Gameworks. I get so into it like you don't even know. Sweat, focus, hand-eye coordination and a little tippy toe so i could see where the ball is going. I got hit on the head with a loose basketball by the kid 2 spaces away from me and I'm still going. I'd wake up the next day with my shoulders and calves feeling sore - but oh my gosh, it's so fun! I got people watching me when I play - I'm either such a badass at playing or there isn't a free hoop to shoot.

I tried all of the other games when I got tired. I got challenged to play Air Hockey by my sister and a few other people - I owned every single one of them.

But what I'd like to know is: what is that green phallic thing they have for prizes?"

Games are always broken down, card readers have a serious issue of not reading or taking others credits. It's sad when a business like this isn't taking care of their own product. Food is great, the Servers are not. There are a select few servers that have their heads together and ones I do enjoy having around, some even go as far to make the guest feel like they are worth being there which I do Enjoy. Young Lady Sahara she is an outstanding server, Another Alonzo? If i remember right, went as far to make my child birthday a day to remember. None the less the place seems like a cesspool of drama. Bad when you hear the employees talking bad about one another calling each other vulgar names behind their back. that's just sickening and very unprofessional, even worse when the managers don't respond to any calls going out or giving you some BS excuse, Doesn't help looks like a few of them are under the influence of something. These are things that make me wonder why is this place still running or why haven't they got a change of people. You walk in the place, you can feel that there is something going on, Don't get me started on that Dark Ride game, That was just a huge mistake.

Will I be returning here, high chance I will not. Should others be cautious on what's going on there? Yes! Do understand this place is suppose to be family friendly, That place is by far not as ""Family Friendly"" as it seems. Please be aware when you walk into this place, if you have kids and wish to eat, please sit away from the booths. Filthy Mouths and Filthy Minds shouldn't be serving your family food."

I have to say that the all-day game card isn't really worth it. By two or three hours, you'll probably have had your fill of gaming. The arcade is not really that big. If you're there on a weekend, like we were, you'll have to deal with rude Vegas people cutting in front of you while you're waiting in line for a game. That was not fun. I feel like they could have cut back on the dining area, which seemed empty most of the time, to add more room for arcade games.

We ate dinner there and I thought it was reasonably priced for Vegas (except for the $9 mozzarella sticks). The food was good. 

The location adds a lot of value to this place. When my younger kids got bored with games, we were able to go play at the Town Square park. When the whole family was bored, we went and saw a movie at the AMC theater. We had planned to spend the whole day just doing GameWorks, but quickly discovered that it wasn't entertaining enough for an entire day, so I'm glad that we had all the other Town Square options to choose from."

The bar was fairly crowded so my friend and I grabbed a seat in the dining space where there was ample seating.  First and foremost, the beer and cocktail menu is not only beautifully curated, but hilarious and witty with on-trend references like the 3am Snap Story cocktail.  I had a Platform Xmas ale which was one of the best Christmas ales I've tried.  

 As far as the food goes... I was able to try the food at a previous Yelp event and I'm drooling over the fries right now. They offer tasty, unique bites that they serve until late which is a nice option over the usual 24-hour diner fare.  Staff is friendly and accommodating. 
Additionally, they are always hosting clever events like The Oregon Trail bar crawl.

While I was there, some guy at the bar bought the whole house of 20+ people a round of shots. That's the kind of place Yuzu is.  
It's warm, it's friendly, it's unpretentious.  It's your new Cheers.

I paid $54 for 400 credits for future use.  The menu looks appetizing, but way too expensive.  I got one draft beer and it was $7!  The best part of this location?  It is right across the sidewalk from Yard House.  We will likely use GameWorks as entertainment for our kids while my wife and I hit happy hour at Yard House.  Unless they come up with a happy hour with major discounts, I will never buy food or drink here.  Without drastic improvements this location will become the hangout for kids waiting for their movie at AMC, and that will mean once my 400 credits run out, my card will be permanently filed in the circular canister."

Many games don't work, and a lot of the seats on the ones that do are disgusting. There are literally huge holes in the seats, where you can see all the filthy foam inside. Less than half of the basketball games were on, and there were only 3 balls in each, so you waste a lot of time waiting for the balls to be returned. A lot of the 2-player shooting games are missing one gun,so you can't play them together. 

They finally  got a dark ride, and I have always loved that attraction. It's fun, but too short. I'm glad I got to try it here while it's still new, before it looks like the rest of the building. 

I'm not sure how this place went down hill so fast, but it looks depressing in there, and it's pretty gross. I probably won't be going back."

This new location is much smaller than the previous one located on the strip, however, you can still find something that everyone will like. The main gaming area has games that I haven't seen in any other Las Vegas arcades including ticket, shooter, driving, 4D, old school and Japanese games. They even have Purikura inside! There is a section for PC and console games as well as a section for bowling. The bar area is a good size with plenty of seating inside and outside of the store. The seats also aren't located next to the games so it's nice not having people constantly walk around you while you eat (unlike Dave and Buster's).

The only downside is that these games are expensive because you pay with ""points."" I suggest buying the package deal where you have unlimited play for 1 hour. We were offered this deal when a friend bought a drink at the bar so I'm not sure if a drink purchase is required."

Surprisingly, the place was actually crowded. Our first order of business was to get a drink at the bar, and the drinks ain't cheap. All draft beers, regardless of type or brand, were $6.50. We ordered 2 Stella Artois and were served quick enough, but were thereafter virtually ignored by the staff.

Onward to the arcade! We were disappointed when we realized we would NOT be earning any tickets for the night (because half the fun of going to arcades is collecting tickets to redeem random shit you'll never use). Anyhow, we had fun playing the games we would have never played if we were using a ticket generating game card. The arcade is smaller than I'd like- with most of the games, you had to race some 14 year old runt to play anything. 

I would really give Gameworks a 3.5 rating. They lose points for having expensive ass draft beers, poor service at the bar, and a limited section of games. All in all though, I would still return if I'm ever in the mood for it. I'll just get my drinks elsewhere!"

( Chicken/Fried chicken/and some other one i forgot) plus the yuzu fries.The skewers were honestly nothing crazy and Im pretty sure we finished them in less than 5 mins they were pretty small. They werent expensive just not filling at all. So i guess they are good for a snack?  The yuzu fries on the other hand, I would come back for. The sauce on them was sooooo good.

Pricey, but not outrageous.

Food: We shared the pico de gallo, and I had a shrimp taco (although I'd ordered fish - see 'Service', below) and the mushroom burrito. 

We also shared the churro sundae and the fudge plate. Everything was very good - fresh, flavourful, satisfying, good portions, and not too heavy (except dessert, but hey, when you order a churro sundae you know what you're in for).

Drink: I had a cocktail, which was very nicely constructed; a good balance of sweet/dry. The beer selection looked good as well.

Atmosphere: we were outside on a sunny day on comfortable furniture - can't ask for more than that!

Service: Some of the issue can be chalked up to inexperience and understaffing, but a lot was a simple lack of polish and organization. I think the layout may also have contributed - pathways are a smidge tight and the bar seems to be a specific area of difficulty (although I usually expect to wait longer for a cocktail, the beer took even longer).

I want to be clear- everyone was very friendly, energetic and kind, which is the most important thing. However, all the staff seemed to lack important service basics - empty plates/glasses were left on the table throughout our meal; dishes went to the wrong table, or werethe wrong order; it took our neighbours 15 minutes to get water; servers were having what should have been private conversations about restaurant issues in front of diners, etc. etc.

I'm rooting for Chula, and I do recommend it! I just hope that the service issues can be sorted out before too long, and I can update this review :)"

Hosted my son's 6th bday in the cosmic bowling area for 25 - kids & adults. The kids bowled first, since we had to get them shoe'd up, bumpers & smaller-sized bowling balls; we ordered drinks & started snacking, leaving time for the kids to eat after they bowled w/ the adults settled in. The timeline worked out perfect for us. 

For food, we went with: 
- Fresh Fruit Tray -very fresh pineapples, melon, grapes, strawberries & blackberries; this is a huge colorful tray & loved it

-Caesar Salad - Crisp with dressing on the side- loved the dressing, was surprisingly tasty as I didn't know what to expect

-Baked Ziti -  this was also really surprisingly pleasing & a crowd favorite

-Pizzas - I didn't try personally, but the first order was gobbled up so we ordered a second round that was also destroyed

Overall, our hosts were super accommodating, worked with us within our budget & even helped us extend our party so that we could open gifts with family after everyone bowled/played in the arcade. A+ service!

We added on the 2 hour game cards. If you rent the bowling area, I'd skip the games. First of all, it's a madhouse & hard to keep track of the little ones. We could have just bowled w/ everyone (disclaimer: because we had so many adults, it was fun for the kids to clear out for awhile so adults had some space to bowl). The timed game cards are confusing- they don't work on many games & no tickets. The solution would be to get the paid game cards that play for tickets. I heard the cocktails were light but wines & beers appeased - I would stick with the mid-level bar tickets over the premium & next time - also comes w/ a variety of soft drinks in the package, refills included.

As far as kids parties go in an arcade setting, I highly recommend. I loved how easy going, yet attentive the planners and staff were. A solid 4.5 kid's party."

It is unlike other gaming lounges in that they don't integrate the gaming, food and bar areas very well. They have a defined bar and restaurant area that is pretty much empty every time I've ever passed through and then there is a small gaming floor with a mixture of ticketed gaming machines for kids and other video game machines. 

I think if they had spread this area out a bit more there would be more room to move around and enjoy the games. It was overly crowded and there weren't too many games that looked worth the time and money to play. The only ones that did were packed and had long waits.

There are so many improvements that could be made here to make it better."

I think if mostly all you do is burgers they should be cooked the way you asked for and we were the only table they were cooking for at the time. We ordered two burgers and asked for one medium rare and the other medium. The medium rare one came out rare. The medium one came out medium well. So both of us were slightly disappointed but being one off we could manage and didn't want to waste time having one thrown back on. 

The burger I had seemed to be seasoned nice with a slight charr. About half the people are like me and will only eat half the roll because that's too much bread to eat. I thought the house made garlic knot was good and not too garlicky with the burger. (but I only ate the smaller half not the whole roll) But my companion eat the whole thing and said all together it was too much garlic so it can go either way.

The truffle string fries are OK but don't didn't taste truffles on our visit. Maybe they left it off or maybe they use real truffle oil that's very delicate? Usually if you taste a lot of truffle flavor it's artificial truffle aroma. So that may be a good thing that we didn't taste the truffle.

We both had margaritas and I'd pass on them them next time as they were large and too much mixer in proportion to booze.

Two burgers that came with the fries and two margaritas about $40.00 before tip."

So first I will start off with the brunch service....$2 mimosas anyone? Granted they aren't extremely strong but they are only $2 and still hit the spot! The bloody mary is exceptional as well!

As far as happy hour specials, I think it's a fair assumption to say that Brickhouse has the best happy hour specials in the Cuyahoga Falls area. Drinks are cheap and selected apps are half off. Totally worth it!

I had my 24th birthday here in 2016 and Brickhouse was fabulous. They had the table ready for my party of 12 as soon as we arrived on a Saturday night.

The cocktails and shot combos are pretty out there in terms of ingredients and flavor combinations (cinnamon and tomato water!?) but somehow they work. Not what I'd normally be looking for but interesting / fun to try. Order an amaretto sour made with their house ""triple citrus yuzu juice"" instead of sour mix, it's pretty delish (they should definitely add that to the menu). If all of this sounds good to you and you're not really interested in ordering food, stop reading now and go have a solid evening of drinks at a quirky, fun twist on a local dive.

The food at Yuzu is just terrible. Rice bowls, skewers, and appetizers are all on the small size for the price - $6 for fries, $3 for a skewer with three tiny chunks of chicken on it, etc. The bigger problem is that the food just doesn't taste good. The rice has been gummy - almost to a paste-like consistency - on all three occasions we've tried it. The ""cheater"" bulgogi bowl seemed to just be ground beef cooked with soy sauce, and the chicken teriyaki (the ""food court favorite"") was a meager handful of chicken pieces tossed in a sauce that can only have been made by boiling pure soy sauce down until it's thick enough to coat the chicken as a glaze - it was WAY too salty to eat. It would be way better (i.e. edible) if they just used an industrial-sized jug of foodservice teriyaki sauce. The mall food court is much better sadly, and you get much more for your money.

I really wish the food was even remotely decent, because their concept is fun and unique, and I think I could otherwise have make it a regular late-night haunt."

It looked like a senior's portion at some crap breakfast restaurant like Perkins. I got the wedge salad and a bowl of Mac and cheese - can't really screw either up I guess - but nothing memorable.

Went here thinking it's Mexican food so I should have a lot of options. Yeah, not so much. The items on their menu are not labelled with any gluten info so the waiter's suggestions were really helpful. 

All of the seemingly gluten-free options that are fried, such as tortilla chips and the cornmeal crusted calamari, are contaminated as they are fried in the same vat as the wheat flour fried items. The tortillas for the tacos are made from corn while the burrito ones are made with wheat. About half of the tacos offered are not gluten-free (3 are wheat flour battered), including the chirizo (normally a gluten-free standard) because it is marinated in beer. Noooo! I ended up going with the pollo tacos and they were delicious. For reference, I have a gluten sensitivity and minor cross contamination (few crumbs) doesn't bother me severely. I had no reactions with this place, but I also actively avoided eating the fried items that I knew would be cross contaminated. 

The reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of less for the minimal gluten-free options is because the wait staff are super helpful and try their best to work with your allergies. Also the ambiance of the place is fantastic, especially their back patio, which is a must for summer days. 

TL ;DR minimal GF options, great ambiance"

So Like everyone else, I am very disappointed with this location. I was so excited for it also! I thought that it would be a great addition to the Town Square and was really hoping it could live up to the previous version of Gameworks that was on the Strip.. at least a little. In my opinion however, it does not. Not even close. Which, is understandable actually. The Las Vegas Strip Location was fantastic in many ways. If  the Town Square location could even be 1/4 of what the previous version was, it could be great. 

I agree that first and foremost, this place should be about the games. I also believe that they have really failed at the design of the space as far as the games go. There appear to be a lot of cool games though they are crammed into a corner. The layout is not cool. So clustered and uncomfortable to walk through when there are many players around. 

Staff was all awesome and very accommodating, I will say  that now.

I walked around a bit and saw the space in the back, that appears to be for private events maybe? A few empty rooms with LCD TV's mounted on the walls. I don't know, but I'd rather see that filled with games and maybe some themed rooms. That's another thing.. the space is so stark and boring and as I mentioned previously, the layout is kinda whack. 

The bar specifically, and even a restaurant that serves alcohol should not be something that kids walk through. It's not a difficult fix. There should be a divider wall between those areas. there are a couple of spaces that can be divided off for over and under 21 patrons. I understand that Gameworks will draw many under 21 people, but  as this is Las  Vegas and there is a huge market for the adult kids! As it stands, it's very uncomfortable to sit at the bar. Your back is to the walkway with kids going by, just not cool in my opinion. It even looks uncomfortable for the bartenders and servers to be serving there. 

I know that people reading this: employees, managers, owners and guests alike, will agree, disagree and be every range of emotion available at these reviews that are so negative. It's not easy opening a new place. Going in, everyone knew there were high expectations. 

I can't even go into much else without writing a full website on the subject, but I feel like this Gameworks needs a serious overhaul already. I really look forward to some major changes and hope that they come sooner than later. I will occasionally drop in to help support that.. but I cannot see myself spending money on games until those credits drop or you some form of unlimited play is offered as it has been in the past.. say $20 10pm-until close for adults, and something for the kids on weekends? 

I wish you luck Gameworks! You are responsible for a great many happy and fun memories in my earlier years! I want to be part of something great like that again!"

Only downside tons of children and teenagers everywhere. My friends and I came here for happy hour I believe 9-midnight and it was pretty decent. Happy hour beers were I believe $3 and appetizers $5-$10. We got the mozzarella sticks , pretzel bites, and nachos. Everything was a shareable size between 2 people. The mozzarella sticks and nachos were pretty standard. I like the pretzel sticks but there wasn't enough cheese and if you let them sit too long they became a little tough. Also they have a 8 lane bowling alley. No one was in there besides us so it was a very private experience. We will be back!!!"

Both times I was equally satisfied with the service and food. Water was filled without you having to ask and there were enough waiters to serve everyone. 

I would classify Maxim as a more upscale HK style cafe because they have a lot of the dishes typically served in a regular HK style cafe. The two basic choices between cream and Russian borscht soup also makes me feel this way. There is plenty of variety on the menu like sandwiches, soups, salads, burgers, pasta, curry, rice, steak, lamb and, of course, cakes as they are a bakery. They have regular lunch combos if you want to be frugal, or you can spice things up with more expensive lunch or dinner specials with the choice of salad or lobster bisque as an appetizer and a slice of cake as dessert. 

For lunch I ordered some smoked salmon with shrimp pasta which was one of the lunch specials of the day with Russian borscht soup. The free bread they give you with the soup is not good at all. Very tasteless and cold. The actual soup itself was pretty good and I preferred it over the cream soup I also tried. The portion of the pasta was about average and the sauce used was not very good. However, I was able to eat the food from what my party ordered because their portions were much bigger. I really liked their Caesar salad and mashed potatoes. The deluxe club sandwich was really big and unfortunately, it was a hassle to eat because bits of tuna kept falling out. The Black Forest cake they picked out for me to eat was not to my liking, but that's only because I prefer more sweet cakes.

For dinner I ordered lamb chop with lobster bisque. The soup was made in a HK style which meant the lobster flavour was much more mild than if you were to have it at a typical western restaurant. The lamb was good quality and there was minimal amount of salt, pepper and seasoning which is what I prefer because you get a more clearer taste of the lamb. Others might find it too devoid of seasoning. Maybe it was because the restaurant was almost closing and they had to get rid of their cakes, but they let me choose what type of cake I could have for dessert this time. During my previous lunch visit, I was told there would be an extra $2 charge if I wanted to pick the cake out myself. I chose the mango cheesecake which was not very sweet again, but I guess that ends up being healthier.

All in all, this place has existed for a very long time (25+ years?) for a good reason. You might have to wait for a table on weekends. I would recommend Maxim for lunch and dinner and not for the cakes."

Anyways I've been to this location more than a few times and honestly I like it.

They have a bowling alley, a bar and restaurant, lots of arcade games, you can earn tickets and redeem them for prizes, billiard tables, lots of screens to catch a sports game playing, and even computer and console games area. You can play at the billiards tables for $5 an hr.

Food is your usual bar food I guess there's pizzas, burgers, chicken tenders, sandwiches, salads, etc. They even have a deal where certain items on the menu comes with an hr play of the arcade for like $15 and you can use the cards anytime for 1 hr straight. I kind of have been stashing them cause I have 3 cards.

Seems like a great place for families and people of all ages. Haven't had a bad experience yet and customer service has always been great. I'll definitely be back."

Also an incredible $6 wing special as well (mentioned in my first review) and I always ask that they smash the hottest buffalo and BBQ sauces together when I order them. 10 jumbo wings means 60-cent wings every day if you happy hour here. 

Really delicious Huevos Rancheros available all day. The kitchen here is something else!

Their ""Flight Deck Lager"" is a draft beer made for Taylor Made by Anheuser-Busch, and is similar to a Cass or OB beer but a bit lighter, with a clean aftertaste. It's $3/pint all day long.

Great, friendly service every time. And a bright, airy, north-facing environment with a horizonal view of the Strip and plenty of HDTVs, this is a *perfect* starting point for any bachelor, bachelorette or reunion weekend.

The bartender also had a bad attitude, I questioned a double crown neat because it looked like an ounce and a half.. which is the standard for a shot. She grabbed the glass and went over to her jigger and measured it out but spilled some on the process. The second shot wasn't full but she shot me a look like ""See?!"" so I wasn't gunna piss her off more by telling her I saw it wasn't full I saw her spill some in the process. I did ask if the jigger was only an ounce and she said yes. Super low house pour.. and the fact that the second wasn't full basically meant I paid $15 for a standard shot.

If you remember the GameWorks that was on the strip, this place won't be as spacious and more condensed. Still offers tickets/prizes. Wish they had more games they had in their previous location :( choices pretty much were racing or shooting + the sport arcades. 
Keep you gamecard so with the next visit, you can reload the card and not pay for an extra.

If you plan on spending some time at the bar, plenty of TV's!! The food is rather pricey, so I'd recommend waiting till happy hour (starts 9pm) 
You honestly can't expect any service if you're at the bar just keep that in mind. You might see someone right when you order, then they disappear."

We wanted to check it out and take the kids to do something fun before school started back up. We are locals and this was our 1st time going to Town Square and to Gameworks.   Loved Town Square. .I will have to do another review on that. We entered Gameworks from the bar/restaurant side.  The bar area is pretty big.  On the opposite side of the bar is a huge area for dining.  In fact i think that area is too big.  They should probably reduce the dining area by half to make room for more games. The gaming area was not what i expected it to be.  I mean they had some cool games but i thought the area would be much larger.  The computer gaming room was pretty cool.  My son wanted to play but we didn't get a chance.  It was only $5 an hour to play on the computer. ..next time we go I'll let my kids play in there.  There was a bowling alley in a separate room...we didn't go check it out tho. We didn't eat there this time around so I don't know how the food is. They could do with getting a few more shooter games as those are the kind of games my kids like.  We spent $54 on a play card with 400 credits which was enough for the 3 kids.  Next time we will spend a little more.  Overall this place is pretty cool.  My kids had fun and wanted to stay longer.

Myrah and Joe were great to work with and everything exceeded my expectations. They have a buyout package, so we had the restaurant to ourselves for the evening, and Myrah was great working with our DJ and photo booth and ensuring everything would work for the night of. I arrived before the event started and it being my first visit to charr, I was very impressed with the atmosphere and the staff was working hard to make sure everything looked great. They provided a buffet dinner and the bar was available to employees. Once it got dark, they lit the fire pits on the patio and it had a nice, warm feeling to it. I would definitely recommend them for a private party for a large group (we had about 60 attendees). The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the food was from Aiello's (their sister restaurant), so I can't speak to the food at charr's. But I will definitely return and recommend them based on the service they provided last night and throughout the planning process."

Looked at their menu to order crab cakes and pork tenderloin. I get a call to advise me they are out of pork tenderloin. So I order their ribs. I asked if everything else is okay and they said yes but told me the ribs cost $3 more (they could of waived that). Then 5 minutes later I get a call stating they are out of crab cakes. Again 5 minutes ago I asked if everything else was okay.  First it took over an hour for my food to get delivered Then I get my ribs (not even what I originally wanted ) and I would say I was and am very underwhelmed.

Unfortunately, the lineup was out the door and so we did not get to sit on the patio (even after having made reservations prior). 

Appetizers were yum but small, so we wish we had ordered 2 of everything. We ordered the zucchini fritters, shrimp ceviche, and chorizo corn dog. Ceviche has quite the kick so those who are afraid of spice, beware.

Tacos were small and lacked flavour. We had ordered the spicy butterflied shrimp, pork shoulder, beer battered fish, and soft shell crab. To be honest, they all tasted the same - nothing made them unique or independently flavoured. We actually had to ask ourselves which one we ate after finishing. Also, not sure if we were just unlucky but the soft shell crab one was really fishy and smelled like the ocean.

Desserts, we tried all 3. Churros sundae was probably my favourite of the night!! Other 2 were nothing to rave about. 

Overall I'm glad I tried this place but I'd say it's overrated. I find the menu to be way overpriced for the quality and quantity of food. For $5-$7 a taco, La Carnita is a way better taco joint. I probably will not return."

I had a party of 5 and we got seated quickly but it took no kidding 10-15 min for a server to come to our table. 
After a bit you just stop asking for things because it takes so long.
The layout of where the dining in relation to the kitchen or service booth is too spread out.
This place has the starting of a good thing but I probably won't come back. The first time I gave them the benefit of doubt but the second trip pretty much made the decision for me that this is how gameworks operates.
So, in my opinion just come here for the games don't come here for the food. It's just not worth it."

The meal itself was alright. I got the black pepper chicken and the chicken was tender AF HOLLLLLY. IT WAS GOOD. came with a salad and 2 spring roles.

When you first walk in, the restaurant asks you to please take off your shoes. Word of advice: It's a great idea to wear socks if you don't want to use the slippers provided by the restaurant and if you want to leave with clean feet.  I'm a bit of a germaphobe, so I wasn't too thrilled about taking off my shoes.

From afar, the restaurant looks small but once you are inside, you realize it is much bigger.  The venue has tons of seating and a bohemian-like ambiance. Bampot provides guests with little nooks where they can relax in a comfortable environment. The nooks have carpeting and pillows for you to just lounge. They also have some traditional table settings as well. The idea is to make you feel at home. 

The restaurant also has a room with shelving and tons of games available for play. We didn't play any games on this night but it was nice to know we had the option. 

The menu is also pretty awesome! Bampot can accommodate vegans and people who are gluten and/or lactose intolerant. Talk about a win!

I shared a vegan cheesecake with a friend and it was the best gluten and dairy free cheesecake I have ever had!  I would revisit Bampot just to have another slice of the blueberry cheesecake.  While there, I also tried the gluten and dairy free stew and falafels. Both dishes tasted amazing! I especially liked the falafels. 

Now onto the tea (the real reason we came here). Bampot has an extensive tea menu. They have tons of teas for you to choose from including some featured teas such as Unicorn Blood. It sounds disgusting but it is oh so amazing. My friend bought it and it was delicious. 

Later in the evening, I described the type of tea I was craving to the waitress and she created a tea blend that wasn't on the menu just for me. The tea tasted amazing and everyone in our group tried it and loved it as well. Of course, I had to ask the waitress what she did and she told me she blended strawberry kiwi and apple cider tea. This combination is so amazing, you'll have to try it!!

I highly recommend this restaurant café and believe you will love it too."

Their gyro is why you want to visit. It is very tasty and is a hearty portion. The Taziki sauce is very good too.

had to meet a client here.....yes she had kids, so had to keep them busy!

this location was a lot smaller than the one that was by the MGM, but was a good place to meet....especially since they have alcohol!

ordered a pretty pathetic looking pizza, with game card of course!
....looked bad, but the kids scarfed it down, so who am I to judge, right?

for adults, we ordered a salad with ranch....just ok
a philly cheesesteak sandwhich....again, just ok, meat kind of dry
and a spinach artichoke dip, again just ok

service was good, and we got to let the kiddies run amok in the game area, so that made it nice

don't think I would come here aside from needing to keep kids occupied though
wasn't anything special food wise, but they do have a full bar, so that is a plus"

The service is pretty good except I did find it annoying when the barista in the bowling area would rather be texting on her phone or flirting with the one guy behind the bar than serving other customers.

It does deserve to have a 2 because of where it's located, being the fact that Town Square is my second home. After hours of shopping with the kiddos, they deserve to have their fun. 

Other than that.... This new game works is super boring, not enough games, my kids were bored 20 mins into playing. 

FOOD is crap. They don't even have the option of getting a whole pizza like the old Game Works at MGM. Only a pan size personal pizza for $14. Nachos with ""string"" like shredded chicken which had no taste and hardly anything on them. 

SERVICE. Well, wasn't too great. Had to call her to order and since it was our first time at this location, we had a lot of questions about the menu, and she was a little irritated with our questions. We then finally ordered. We got 2 pepperoni pizzas and chicken nachos. 

She told us if we added $3 more dollars to each of our items, we would get a free play card. So it would've been perfect for not buying more play cards. So we did add the $3 special for the card play, but she didn't mention to us until after we won at least 10,000 points on games that it wouldn't be included on their dinner play cards. 

Not only did the server and this place ruin our dinner, but made my kiddos cry for not getting any prizes they've earned on those games. 

NEVER AGAIN WILL I BE BACK."

As we walked in we were greeted by an adorable young lady who explained the different options for purchasing game cards for the children to use to play the games.  I'm not sure which ""package"" my husband purchased but it was the perfect amount for keeping the kids happy and busy for a few hours!  I don't remember the last time my kids had this much fun.  After an hour and a half or so we decided to sit down and grab a bite to eat.  The kids each got a cheeseburger and fries and my husband and I shared a couple of flatbread pizzas.  We were VERY impressed with the quality of the food we received.  Our server, I can't remember her name, was an absolute doll.  The food came out quickly and hot.  We will definitely be back to try more of the menu items in the future.  A manager even stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our visit.

All in all, it was a fantastic experience for my husband and I as well as our kids who have been begging to go back since we left.  Thanks Gameworks!"

I never post reviews on yelp but this by far was the worst well I can't even called it service since I wasn't even helped.

I like Dave & Busters where it's all more incorporated so parents can sit and still be in same room with kids while they play and we can enjoy food and cocktails.  So instead, I followed the kids around, lugging all the winter coats and hats.

After blowing $80 myself and another $100 with friends, we finally went to eat and ordered a bunch of pizzas.  They tasted more like frozen tombstone pizzas but bigger than I though based on yelp reviews.  The problem was service.  Other than taking the initial order and dropping food, we NEVER saw our waitress.  I had to literally walk around the dining room on three occasions flagging down OTHER waitresses for extra plates, drink refills, etc.  the dining area was NOT full.  Each server had maybe a maximum of 3 tables to serve.  

3 hours after being served and then after 20 minutes trying to hunt down our bill, I finally was fed up.  I saw three managers in a corner and approached them and told them what happened and asked for the bill.  Meanwhile, others in my party asked another waitress for my bill, who then found our waitress, who dropped it off.  We sat there, with credit card in the bill sleeve and again, waited and no one came to pick it up.  So I walked the bill and credit card to the manager myself.  The manager (Heather maybe) was on it.  She apologized profusely and said she understaffed the dining room.  I've waitressed before and if a server can't handle 3 tables, they need better servers. Without us asking, the manager comped the ENTIRE meal and gave us free 1 hour play cards.  

While the experience was frustrating- I would go back simply because management responded so well.  I felt bad too, thinking of leaving a tip for the server- not huge but something.  But I saw her talking to the manager and looking at our table and throwing her arms in the air in disgust and then storming off.  That just really turned me off.  She never apologized for any delay.  Not sure if right or not, and might get a lot of flak but I really don't reward bad servers.  We were a table full of hungry people and we sat with empty plates, etc. for. a long time.  That server really missed the opportunity to sell us a salad, some wings and dessert.  But she never checked in on us.

We will return and try the restaurant again simply to support the business and hope they fix their kinks.  And if we get decent service, we will tip appropriately.  But I hope they work this out- it could've been a great locals addition to Town Square."

By the way I did not know that he was the manager until after my order was fixed. 

    . I tried to tell Joseph which computer My brother, son and I was sitting.  We waited about 30 mins for a personal size looking pizza.  Nick came and check on us 2 times as he always makes his rounds around the cafe every time I've visted.  Finally I asked for his help which he got done faster than Joseph has. Nick completely took care of my brother and son after. But he is just a great up beat worker overall every time we have gone into game works he has been helpful and always checking on the kids.

As we were waiting for our food we played checkers (they have a corner with a bunch of board games). We started with the edamame which was BOMB. Not that edamame is hard to mess up but it had this amazing seasoning on it. Then we both got the chicken tandoori skewers which were incredible. The dipping sauce was great. For entrée I got the vegetable ramen and he got the chicken rice bowl. The ramen noodles were some of the best I've ever had. I ended up actually having to share my bowl with my husband he loved them so much. I liked his chicken bowl but he wasn't a big fan because he said the chicken was too chewy (I thought it was fine).

The crab cakes were cold by the time they reached our table. My medium burger was cooked perfectly, but my wife's well done burger was cold. While the buns were delicious, the burger was slapped together like an afterthought. I had a dollop of BBQ sauce under my top bun and a puddle beneath it. The ice cream in our apple cobbler was clearly freezer burned.

To top it all off, the head chef was wandering around the restaurant, greeting guests and getting kind of touchy feely with people. He also had a conversation with a server about an unhappy customer within earshot of our table.

Look, I get that $33 for two people is on caliber with Chili's, but at least I remember Chili's consistently delivering HOT food -- even if said hot food tastes like hot garbage. If the goal of Restaurant Week is to get people to come back and try more expensive menu items, Charr failed on basically every level."

We asked three employees if it was accepted there because it's not accepted at some locations like Fry's or Whole Foods.  Every one of them said ""I'm not sure but we should take it"" rather than go find a manager and find out.

Anyway we sat down and the waitress (Erika I think) came over to get drink orders.  I ordered a water and she thought I ordered a latte.  My girlfriend ordered a diet coke and the waitress said ""Is diet coke OK?""  :(

Drinks come in the smallest glasses I've ever seen at a restaurant.  My girlfriend orders the pepperoni pizza and I order the steak frites.  It takes a bit too long to arrive, but it finally does.  There is no salt, pepper, or ketchup on any table so we have to ask for all of that.  The steak frites is supposed to come with a tangy ketchup but it is not on the plate so I ask the server about it and she says ""Um, we have buffalo sauce but that's for the wings and I don't even think that's very hot personally ha ha ha.""  I have no idea why she decided to respond to me that way, but whatever.

The fries are OK, the steak is actually pretty good, but my the pizza was very bland and tasteless.  It took way too long to get drink refills, and when we got them the waitress took our straws away and brought us new wrapped straws.  She also tried to pull a plate out from under me as I was still eating something on it.  Finally, at the end of the meal I have my payment card in my hand, all our plates are in front of us with the napkins and utensils on top and the waitress comes by and says ""Oh, do you want some more drinks?""  No I want to pay and leave!  

The food was overpriced ($17 for the steak frites and $4 for the diet coke!) and not that great, but the service was absolutely awful.  I won't be going back again."

We came by for a late lunch on a weekday and it was almost empty and devoid of small children. We sat at the bar and ordered an Irish Mai Tai (has beer in it) and a blackberry Moscow Mule. They weren't exactly stellar cocktails, but they were tasty enough. On the menu are several items where, if you order them, you can opt to pay more and get a 1-hour game card. This seemed like a great deal. We opted for the nachos, which were priced at $12. By paying $14.99, instead of $12, we got a game card for all the games letting us play whatever we wanted for 1-hr. The one catch is that you can't earn tickets when playing with a timeframe card. But you definitely get a lot more play for you money. The nachos were pretty good. Standard bar fare. The selection of games was pretty good, including some unique ones we'd never seen before. In addition to skee ball and some of the other usual suspects, there was also a motion roller coaster ride and a 4D scary shooting game one.

The place was busy, but not packed. My partner found his favorite game (some shooter game where you sit in a booth, and you're a pirate fighting undead pirates), and we initially started having a blast. Next, we found an old school Capcom Vs Marvel game that took our credits, and didn't let us play. My partner went to the check in desk and they refunded the credits. Cool. Then we went to a few other games, and most of those would do the same. I started paying attention and saw that it was happening to others, too. 

After getting frustrated, we found our friend and her son and played a bit with him (some of those kid games are even more fun than the arcade games). The ticket redemption area was a madhouse, as to be expected, but the staff was friendly enough. The trainer could have been more helpful with his trainee, but he was preoccupied with chatting with his coworkers, who found it appropriate to flip one another off in front of small children (but at least the coworker had enough tact to discreetly disguise it as pushing up his glasses). 

Oh, and beers are $8 and up (I thought Town Square was a local's place, not the actual Strip), and the girl at the ticket counter said he average cost of a play was 4-9 credits. Sure.

I remember coming here and being greeted warmly by the staff. However, this time was different. I sat at the bar as I usually do and was given a menu and water right away. When the bartender/server came over to me, I wasn't quite ready with my food order. I ordered a drink and app in the meantime. It was the birthday shots and carrot parsnips fries. After getting my drink, she left to attend another patron. 

This is when the visit started going downhill. The bartender/server came by about every 5 min to ask if I wanted to put an order in and as soon as I could answer, she would be gone. Now, I have been a server/bartender and even on the busiest of nights I, at least, attended to my tables that haven't ordered yet! Still haven't received my app. Finally get to order because the same guy who got me water and a menu thought I looked like I needed help. Fast forward to when the food comes out. It's lukewarm and the rice in the rice bowl I ordered was literally crunchy. The pork belly skewer deserves 5 stars and is the only part of my visit that reminded me of what I loved about this place.

I've been to the old gameworks on the strip, which was pretty old and dank, but was two stories.
I don't see them having enough business to pay for the strip's rent, so I understand.

Moving to the Town Square is a great move.


Pros: 

- Love that they were open until midnight. Went to a movie at 10:45 and wanted to kill time before.
-It was pretty fun 
-The prizes really are better than most places (keep in mind, most prizes are for kids, and kids love these weird prizes)
-Bowling looked pretty cool, didn't see prices though

New ticket system could be seen as pro or con.
All tickets go back on the card

Cons:

-NOTHING FREAKING WORKS. I mean seriously. You just opened.
There is about 7 basketball games, only two worked.
-Operator didn't work (wish I could play that)
-2 wheel spinning games didn't work
-Spaceballs worked and then would flash out of order, then work again.
-Tetris style game didn't work
-A couple of games ate our game card points and didn't work
-A few more games didn't work.

A total of about 1/3 of the games didn't work which is pretty lame since it is really busy in there.

-It definitely should be bigger with more games.
-The gameperks doesn't work here because ""their system isn't synced""
-They are very very slow. Workers took a long time to load points on the cards, one time was out of printer paper and wouldn't let people buy cards for about 20 minutes.
-VIP members have different credit pricing but we can't get the VIP member pricing?

We spent quite a bit of money here for a birthday.
About $130 and got about 8,000 tickets (which are all kept on the card)
Used 3200 for a giant lego pillow (cooler prizes than most places)
Don't know if we will be back"

First off, I really wanted to like the place.  I love the concept and I was expecting to be wowed by my experience.  However, I was really underwhelmed.  We started off with the Yuzu fries which were actually really yummy-the wasabi sauce on top was the shining star.  For our second course, we were able to order two items from their Yakitori menu.  We went with the Top Sirloin Tips and Tandoori Chicken.  The meats were cooked well, but the vegetables it came with seemed like an afterthought and was just thrown there to fill up space.  The sauces they came with were ok, but we preferred to eat our meats without the sauce.  Third course, we chose 2 Bowls- Korean Beef & Little India.  The beef in the Korean Bowl was really tasty, however it could use more ingredients.  It was literally just rice, beef, sriracha and a scattering of green onions- maybe an addition of carrots, bean sprouts and spinach would be nice with some gochujang sauce.  Little India was just bland.  All the ingredients seemed to be mashed together and it just looked so sad.  I really appreciated the effort on doing something new in the area and service was friendly.  I'll definitely come back for cocktails and yuzu fries!"

Their beef taco was well seasoned, butterfly shrimp, and pork shoulder were all decent. We also had the corn as an appetizer and that was good too. The guacamole is the kind you'd make at home.

Cons -- The service and cocktails left much to be desired. Let's start with the cocktails. The bartender was sniffing the drinks rather than tasting them while making them. This resulted in a very limey cocktail (the El Rey and the Humo Grande). 

The service was patchy at best. We had to ask for hot sauce with our tacos (they were on some of the other tables) and even when the server brought them over, there was only one.

My first awful experience with this place was back in January of 2015. We went for my little brother's birthday, and he was super excited to win a prize from the arcade. When we told our waiter this, he offered us the all you can play for 2 hours pass, and we thought: ""perfect, we can earn a bunch of tickets and get him something fun!"" It wasn't until the two hours ended and we tried to redeem our tickets that we were informed we did not win any tickets, the pass just gave us unlimited game play. My brother was heartbroken, and we walked out empty handed, and when we complained to the front desk they refused to do anything for us, and told us we should have specifically asked the waiter. What?! I wrote this same review on their facebook page, and management never responded. I have sworn off going here since then, but last night I decided to give it another shot since my fiance wanted to play some games for his birthday. 

I would give this experience two stars as well. A lot of games were not working, and the games that did work were EXPENSIVE. I get that it's in a tourist-y area, but really? 9 credits for one game where you don't get a substantial amount of tickets? It's not like the prizes you offer are anymore reasonably priced, and the cheap prizes are dollar store things. 

Also, management decided it would be advantageous to dust their ceiling off as my fiance and I were standing right next to them. We were playing a game when dust just came pouring down on us - seriously?! You couldn't warn us first? Afterwards, when we walked away, the manager made eye contact with us, saw us covered in dust, and didn't say anything. I was appalled. 

I have tried to like this place, but I just can't. I know D&B has had some issues in it's first few weeks, but I would rather spend my time there then spend anymore time at Gameworks - they've been open for at least two years and they still can't get it together."

There's arcade games,  bowling, pool, large tv's for sports, a bar, food; with all of that you're going to be entertained at some point. It's just like Dave and Buster's if you know what that is, but maybe a little better. I would definitely come back, and also suggest that you try it, cool place to hang out and there's so many other things within walking distance of this place(food,  bars, clubs, shopping, movie theater)."

An izakaya isn't merely a bar serving Japanese food, as there are many bars in Japan that serve food and aren't considered izakayas. An izakaya is more akin to a Japanese TAPAS bar, which has a wide variety of appetizers and small bites to choose from. Yuzu has a small sampling of appetizers, but the menu items are mostly standard and so I'd consider it more just an Asian fusion bar.

The atmosphere was nice, and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. The food was ok - my friend got the Korean beef rice bowl, which the menu admits to using ""cheater"" bulgogi. The beef was ground up, whereas bulgogi is more in thin slices. The flavor was not too bad, though it was the type of dish I could get at almost any restaurant. 

I personally got the ahi tuna poke, because poke has been on the rise in the States and I have been trying to sample poke everywhere. While the colors and presentation were solid, the flavor was not to par. The tuna was very tough to chew and did not taste particularly fresh. When I have poke, I typically anticipate that the tuna has been marinated in various sauces for a fairly long time, but this dish tasted like the sauce was recently added on. I also felt like there was not enough sauce in general. Additionally, the mangoes and avocado seemed to stand in contrast to the fish rather than complement it.

I do enjoy the atmosphere at Yuzu, and the staff were extraordinarily friendly. However, I think the food could use some work in terms of flavor."

By comparison,  this new location is a ton newer but also smaller. It's nice to see that everything isn't falling apart and all the games are clean and actually work!

I'm not sure though why they made the restaurant area so large because Gameworks is usually an arcade first and restaurant second. I've been to multiple locations around the country and all of them have a much much larger gaming area than restaurant. The restaurant also has a ton of wasted space that could've been used to accommodate games so that it doesn't feel as cramped inside when you're playing. The only thing I like about the restaurant is the TVs and projector screens they have all around. Makes this a great place to watch sports!

The games themselves are decent although not a whole lot seemed to spark my interest. Most of them are pretty expensive too, costing approximately 7-12 credits. Each credit is 25 cents unless you buy in large dollar amounts such as $50-100.

Overall Gameworks at Town Square is a good place to hang out or kill some time, but wouldn't be a place I'd visit frequently."

I came on a Saturday afternoon with my partner and the place was not extremely packed. We were taken to our tables and the waiter was quite quick to get our order. 

I ordered curry chicken with rice while my partner ordered the honey glazed pork chop. The curry tasted quite sweet, and not as curry-ish as I had expected. The chicken was alright when combined with the curry. The rice, however, was quite dry. Having it with curry didn't make it much better. As for my friend's pork chop - it tasted quite bland. It was served with cranberry sauce, which was not a good combination for my friends taste. His dish also came with steamed vegetables - which were basically frozen vegetables. They were also, quite bland. I think the only part I liked from his plate was the cranberry sauce. The portion was pretty large for both our dishes, but for the quality was a bit of a disappointment. 

Here is the main reason why we came for a visit: Dessert! I was told from my friend (we are both avid dessert lovers) His favourite being the Mango Meringue Cake offered at Maxim. However, he did warn me the cakes are sometimes really good  and sometimes average (inconsistent quality). When we tried it, the meringue was quite delicious. However, there was so much cream and not that much mango bits. So, the proportion didn't fit quite well, so the experience wasn't anything special for me. They have other cakes though. I would give them a try again, if I ever visit Toronto again. But perhaps not for the meals."

So we were sitting in the esports couch area and we were told to leave the area. I was a little annoyed but understandable. i asked the assistant manager to find a place for her to sit. he was an excellent manager. i forgot their names but the assistant helped us. hes a middle eastern/asian looking. skinny good looking guy. he took us to an vacant room for us and it was really nice. then the main manager who looks like a typical redneck trash who told us to leave because we brought food from home. we understood but we were willing to spend money to cater her very need. but she would not let us. so we had to walk across the store again back to the car. We were here before and they just lost their regular customers. Fire the main manager and promote the assistant. 

p.s. they made a 95 year old woman walk all over the store. if something happened.... i know you dont care about her but think about your job. if something happened to her..... your going to get sued. and were from los angeles. we sue."

We had like 3 managers within the first 6 months. But our bar manager was AMAZING.The drinks are poured strong, and accurately. The kitchen staff works very hard. And the girls bust their butts.
As far as the food goes; COME ONE PEOPLE... Its a bar! Its not a gourmet 5 star restraunt. The burgers arent that good. The Kobe is just ok. The Mahi Mahi is delicious (in the fish sandwich) The philly cheesesteak is sooo good. Make sure you get peppers and onions. Chicken in waffles is good as well. Drunkin pork chops are moist, perfectly cooked, and the sauce is amazing. All of the apps are good. The wings are kind of average ( i am a wing snob )
Since I havent been working there I see they have added more items to the menu.
Cant wait to go in and check them out.

To the women who was like ""omg there was T & A EVERYWHERE!!!""
Come on. We were never aloud to have our butts hanging out of our shorts.
And yeah ok some girls might have big boobs and heaven forbid are showing some clevage. I just think its so funny how narrow minded people can be.
'they must all be hookers!"" Yeah right lady. Every girl likes the outfit, wears it proud with confidence, and busts her ASS on a daily basis. I made soooo much money when I worked there.

The food, the friendly staff, the overal ambiance of the place- it's all spot on.  It's a great place to go to grab a bite to eat and/or a drink with friends and just relax.  

 For the true American man who like to sit on the couch and watch some good old fashioned TV while they eat, they've got TV's everyehere and couches, yes i said that correctly, COUCHES as well as arm chairs with detchable trays. Or if you're just looking for somewhere to bunker down with some friends for a couple hours to watch your favorite teams on a big screen with a few beers then this is the place for you.  They have couches and beer bongs.  Need i say more?

For us women out there that might be looking for a little more ambiance than big screens and couches in our dinner plans, they've also got regular tables, booths and outdoor patio seating where you can just sit, chat and take in the awesome food and decor.  They have 2 huge, awesome fireplaces- one in door and one out door that are just beautiful to take in.The sayings on the walls are hilarious so take a second to read them all (my personal favorite is ""I drink to make other people more interesting""  ;-)), there is framed underwear outside the restroom doors (a thong indicating the women's room and boxers indicating the men's room) and just in case that all wasn't great enough- there is a little bit of framed eye candy in the restrooms as well.  Don't worry it's nothing graphic that you would want to hid your childrens eyes from, but just enough to put a smile on your face ;-)  

The food is really quite good- kind of like bar fare with a little bit of a high end twist- and it really works.  I've been there 4 or 5 times, have had something different everytime, and have yet to be disappointed.  The drinks are awesome as well.  I highly reccomend the ""Bee's Knees"" if you're into mixed drinks- it's a bit sweet so you'll probably only want to do one or 2 of them but frankly, that's all most people have with dinner anyways so it's perfect. 

And for those of you that were concerned with the waitress' dress code... that is a non-issue anymore.  They have standard clothes on these days so no need to shy away from coming back.

My only 2 complaints would be that I wish they had some more healthy options on the menu.  And once they address that, they should move closer to my house ;-)"

I had to go up to the waiter and ask if we were going to get our order. An older woman came in and was hustling around, accomplishing more than our waiter! Joe finally came in, came to our table, and while assuring us that there would be no charge for our lunch had to ask what our order had been.  This is 50 minutes after we came in!  He was full of excuses and repeatedly asked us not to yelp him.  Sorry Joe but the public needs to know and you need to pay attention to the number of recent bad reviews. I ordered your Phoenix Burger and it was tasteless, maybe because it had to be cooked so quickly. You never even asked about why I didn't finish it in spite of standing next to me and seeing 3/4 of the burger sitting on my obviously finished with plate! Your waiter never, ever apologized to us. Everybody has bad days in business but take note, apologies go a long way to getting people to try you again.  Fire that waiter, get a better cook, and apologize when your staff screws up."

That visit was shortly after they opened, and employed  scantily-clad women to chat up the male customers as they perused the menu and stole quick (but obvious) glances to check out the warm, um... atmosphere.  

Not to be deterred by serving a table for two which included 1 female, our  fetching young server made herself more than comfortable, sitting down for a chat after taking our orders. Really? We had gone to lunch to try the food and have a conversation while not having to prepare and serve our own food. Apparently we sent a signal that we wanted to discuss our upcoming holiday weekend (only one of the various pleasantries attempted) with a skinny, surgically enhanced stranger clad in bare-midriff. It was so awkward, both of us declared it ridiculous - so much so, that it was at least a year before we returned. In fact, neither of us remembered the food. I guess that should have been a tip-off for any future visits. 

Visit #2 - I don't recall what my friend ordered, but I had a piece of fish. A really really large piece of fish. Large as in - I now think I know where the word ""codpiece"" came from. I was certain that upon lifting this piece of fish, I would find the lost city of Atlantis beneath it. As far as the flavor - meh - pretty much bland - but I think i was turned off by the size. I'm not fond of taking ""fish"" home in a takeout container. I might as well toss it into the trash. Upon further inspection, I found it to be eclipsing a serving of haricot verts and some sort of potato hash - neither one being a side dish I would go back for. The best thing about this visit was the noticeable change in servers. Gone were the briefly-attired females.. replaced by respectfully dressed male servers throughout the dining room. So there was that. 

Last week - This was a ""joke gift"" visit. A friend had purchased a gift card, not realizing that the place was no longer a thinly veiled Hooters restaurant. 
I hoped for the best when I opted to stick with a wedge salad, and requested dressing on the side (the choice was bleu cheese), and SANS bacon. My friend ordered the ribs, and we asked for the Sweet and Spicy Tails appetizer, described as follows: crispy shrimp, cherry peppers, fresh cilantro, lime & sweet chili sauce. 

The appetizer arrived, and we were thrilled when we first saw the portion size. Thrilled until we realized that there were only 5 very ordinary medium-sized shrimp  for which we practically needed a search party, among a huge portion of crispy fried onions. We are not onion lovers, so had we realized the appetizer was mainly  the onions with a couple of shrimp, we would have likely chosen differently. 

Our food arrived, and my friend pronounced the ribs ""OK"". The real freak show here was my salad, which was not just a wedge, but possibly an entire head of iceberg lettuce, chopped into 3 portions and placed core-down on the plate, with (can you guess?) bacon decorating it. I started to point them out to the waitress and she looked closely, declaring them to be pecans. Yikes. Absolutely bacon. The dressing was from a bottle. No bread was served, other than two pieces of toasted white bread (fresh from the wonder bread wrapper, no doubt) that came with my friend's rib entree. 

The one star? For the interior - the large fire in the oversize see-through fireplace as you enter is warm and inviting. The place was nearly empty on a Thursday evening, while the other area restaurants appeared to be packed. Brick House really needs to upgrade their food to bring me back. So much great indie local fare, why bother with a chain restaurant serving very average fare?"

Again it was great entertainment for the kids. However I was frustrated by the many machines that were not working at all or in desperate need of repair. I was recently at a Dave and Busters where the games were newer and in better shape. Still a nice off Strip option for kids, but I hope the games are updated and repaired soon."

They failed to do much with spot other than paint walls place chairs and tables.. A few TVA and  games..  Not much more to see. 
The food was terrible and considering there was only one other family there you would think they could do a better job. My caesars salad was soaked with dressing and soggy. The chicken was okay. My husbands fish and chips were dripping with old oil.. But the kids seemed to like the chicken strips and French fries. I think the only thing that was okay to me was the calamari and aioli dip. 
The rides/ games were extremely over priced. However  at least the service was excellent. Laura our waitress was great and made sure we never had to ask for a refill. She was the one bright spot. 
We don't have plans to go back.. Rather wait til we travel to a place that has a Dave and busters."

The games are also sorted by type, and there's a detailed list included with the menu to help you choose (it lists the time to play and number of players). The service is friendly, the prices reasonable, and, again, the tea selection impressive. Highly recomend."

I feel like the prices are reasonable in locations that have more to offer but this place didn't offer much. I'm very disappointed."

I've never been to brick house pre-revamp, but I've heard some horror stories (from women) and I gotta say the new uniforms are better suited to the atmosphere. Covered up women allow the restaurant to do what it's supposed to do: dazzle the fuck out of you. Decor is simple, tasteful and upscale, and the food is amazing. Drink selection is one of the best I've seen. Beer for years, cocktails are mixed right. This isn't applebees though, so your wallet is gonna take a hit. Two cocktails and chops ran me $40. Absolutely. Fucking. Worth it. Stop reading, go there. Now."

The atmosphere also gets a 5 star rating.  Where else can you sit on a couch, eat food that is brought to you and watch TV all at the same time?

But here's where it ends for me.  I WILL NOT PATRON A PLACE THAT REQUIRES/LETS THE WAITRESSES WEAR SHORT SHORTS AND TEENY TANKS THAT HIDE NOTHING.  Especially in the dead of winter.  It's gross and disgusting to see things I'm not in the mood to see when I just want to eat.  2nd, being a hetero woman, I'm not really into looking at coochy or boobies.  I'm also NOT into women selling their bodies just for a few more dollars in tips.  I WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS PLACE!!!  If I could give a negative rating, this is the area I would do it in.

Oh, and YES, I did complain and tell this all to management and the main company."

Went there today after several poor experiences in the past. Trying to give Charr one more chance.  No one greeted us for at least 10 minutes.  When the very tan, blond woman finally approached us, she was very kurt and I never did see a smile one her face.  We ordered drinks, which were delivered in a timely manner but when we were ready to order we found her to become very rude when I asked about customizing my meal.  When I finally conceded to her inflexibility she rudely snatched the menu out of my hand, with a nasty look on her face and stomped off in the direction of the computer to place our order.  At that point I decided we were through.  I expressed my feelings in what was probably an inappropriate way, left a few bucks to cover the cost of our drinks and headed for the door.  As we did, the server said, ""don't f**king f**k me!""

There are only 3 reasons to go out to eat in my opinion.  Good food, good ambience, good service.  Food has been good when I have eaten and the ambience is good but the poor service combined with ugly attitude makes this place a disaster...  

Yeah, won't be going back here ever again...."

I went to GameWorks for a big group dinnertime outing. We didn't get any special rates, just their Dine & Play combo that's always available. For $14.99, you get one of their time cards loaded for one hour, and one of ten specially labeled items on the menu. It's also possible to do $21.99 for a two-hour card, but nobody chose that option.

Like some of the others, I went with the Fish & Chips because it's normally $14.50, which is almost the price of the Dine & Play one-hour deal. I wasn't expecting much, but the cod fillets were reasonably flavorful. It's unfortunate that they seemed a little heavy rather than fluffy, and the batter wasn't as crispy as I'd hoped. I chose waffle fries for the side rather than mashed potatoes or salad, neither of which can really be called chips. The fries were decently seasoned and generally had a decent crisp and some fluffiness, but I've had better.

I also sampled the GameWorks Nachos (normally $12) with steak (+$3). I suppose that the meat could be construed as ""ground steak"" instead of ground beef. Nothing in the dish was anything special. I even prefer the TGI Friday's nachos over this.

I should note that they handled service for our rather massive table (20+ people) just fine, with constant replacement of water pitchers too, although condiments (notably ketchup for my fries) were a bit delayed.

As for the arcade, I only partook in one round of DDR Supernova 2 because I'd handed off my card to a friend while playing pool ($13/hr Sun-Thu 4pm-close, but I think they weren't too strict on the one hour). The pool tables and cues seemed decent enough, although someone noted that one of the rails seemed to be a bit dead. Anyway, from what I saw my friends play, the arcade had a nice selection of shooting games, air hockey, a crazy souped up Pac-Man inspired version of air hockey, some rhythm games, and some racing games. I've seen worse arcades for sure.

I should note that all the TVs were set to the Monday Night football game, with audio available seemingly everywhere in the building. This was fun for casual fans and for vocal Cowboys fans alike. They also have a football game-day food promo that I believe was $35 for a large (16"") one-topping pizza, 35 wings, a pitcher of soda (or +$5 for a pitcher of beer), and one-hour game cards at $5 per person. I also noticed that they offer $10 unlimited gaming on Thursdays 5pm-close and immediately wished that the social had taken place then. Oh well.

I don't foresee myself coming back very soon, but GameWorks has some potential appeal for arcade gaming. Just don't expect too much from the food and you'll be fine."
"_y54HcEDbKSnFo8QZcKvqA","Kate","1WBkAuQg81kokZIPMpn9Zg","Charr An American Burger Bar","3","2012-06-24 00:00:00","Although happy to find another decent place to eat in the Lovely's hood, this was not a 5 star experience. 

The good: revamped Market Bistro space is attractive and the bar selection solid. The burgers were very good and the garlic knots they're served on, equally delicious. The portions were fair - that is not overly generous or skimpy - and the food was fresh. Service was prompt and hostesses polite. Owner came through twice to ask about our experience. Prices are okay. 

The not so good: We were put at a table that did not have proper clearance between us and the next table on one side and a booth on the other. It meant that a large woman's stomach met my back as she passed through. Mmmm blech. Wait staff frequently hit the chair. I moved to the other side which meant that no one could get through there but it moved traffic around the two tables. Music, although nice, was too loud. 

For the number of families we saw in there, this does not read as kid friendly. I have a 10 year old for whom we ordered sliders without the peppers and chipotle mayo and although we could've sprung for a milk shake [hello more sugar] water was about my only other option and bonus! free. Now, I'm not expecting the crayon greeting that we get at CPK, but it just didn't have the family vibe to me. Kiddo liked the burger and the brownie dessert [which came as described on the menu but without the whipped cream] and the lovely seconded the dessert thumbs up. 

My flat iron salad had freshly cut romaine, homemade croutons, some bermuda onion, corn and black beans and a slice of tomato that was cut in half. I asked for the dressing on the side. It came with a good portion of sliced flatiron steak that although cooked well, had zero seasoning and the dressing on the side was described as a southwest caesar. I didn't get southwest and I did get blah/lacking in flavor. 

Bottom line, we'd go back but for the burgers only. Cost of the meal for three of us with no drinks, only water, was $40. Its nice that its in the hood and that there is good food but overall it was good, not great."
