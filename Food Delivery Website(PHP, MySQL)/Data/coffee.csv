1,Moka,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot,"Moka coffee is coffee brewed with a moka pot, a stovetop coffee maker which produces coffee by passing hot water pressurized by steam through ground coffee at a lower pressure than an espresso maker. The moka pot is an Italian invention, first produced by Bialetti in the early 1930s. The flavor of moka pot coffee depends greatly on bean variety, roast level, fineness of grind, and the level of heat used. Due to the higher-than-atmospheric pressure involved, the mixture of water and steam reaches temperatures well above 100 °C, causing a more efficient extraction of caffeine and flavors from the grounds, and resulting in a stronger brew than that obtained by drip brewing."
2,Espresso,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappuccino,"Espresso is brewed by using an espresso machine to force a small amount of nearly boiling water and steam – about 86 to 95 °C (187 to 203 °F) – under pressure through finely ground and compacted coffee.[17][18] The espresso machine was patented in 1901 from an earlier 1884 machine,[19][20] and developed in Italy; with the invention of the Gaggia machine, espresso spread in popularity to the UK in the 1950s where it was more often drank with milk as cappuccino due to the influence of the British milk bars,[21][22][23] then America in the 1980s where again it was mainly drank with milk,[24] and then via coffeehouse chains it spread worldwide.[3] Espresso is generally denser than coffee brewed by other methods, having a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids; it generally has a creamy foam on top termed ""crema"".[25] Espresso is the base for a number of other coffee drinks, such as latte, cappuccino, macchiato, mocha, and Americano."
3,Guillermo,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Doppio.jpg,"Originally one or two shots of hot espresso poured over slices of lime. It can also be served on ice, sometimes with a touch of milk."
4,Ristretto,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coffee_drinks.jpg,"Ristretto is traditionally a short shot of espresso made with the normal amount of ground coffee but extracted with about half the amount of water. Since ristrettos are essentially the first half of a full-length extraction, the faster-to-extract compounds predominate in a ristretto. The opposite of a ristretto is a lungo, which is typically double the shot volume. Ristretto means “limited” or “restricted” in Italian whereas lungo means “long."
5,Espresso Romano,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coffee_drinks.jpg,"An espresso Romano is a shot of espresso with a slice of lemon served on the side. The lemon can be run along the rim of the cup as a way to accentuate the espresso's sweetness.[38] Despite the name, it has no link to Italy nor Rome."
6,Cafe Zorro,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coffee_drinks.jpg,"A Cafe Zorro is a double espresso or doppio, added to hot water with a 1:1 ratio."
7,Caffè crema,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coffee_drinks.jpg,"Caffè crema (Italian: cream coffee) refers to two different coffee drinks:[35] an old name for espresso (the 1940s and 1950s), and a long espresso drink primarily served in Germany, Switzerland and Austria and northern Italy (the 1980s onwards), along the Italian/ Swiss and Italian/ Austrian border.[36] As a term, it generally means ""espresso"", while in technical discussions, referring to the long drink, it may more narrowly be referred to as Swiss caffè crema. Variant terms include ""crema caffè"" and the hyperforeignism ""café crema"" – ""café"" is French, while ""caffè"" and ""crema"" are Italian, thus ""café crema"" mixes French and Italian."
8,Café Cubano,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coffee_drinks.jpg,"Cuban tradition is to drink coffee strong and sweet, often mixing the sugar with the coffee beans before brewing. The traditional method of brewing coffee was a filter method using a cloth cone; this has mostly been replaced with an aluminium cafetera or coffeemaker—in tourist areas some cafés will have an espresso machine, though espresso machines are expensive, so espresso is not a common drink for most Cubans.[27][28] Though quality coffee is grown in Cuba, it is expensive, so most Cubans drink coffee imported from Puerto Rico, and often mixed with ground peas.[29][30] The Cuban habit of brewing coffee with sugar has spread to Miami, West Palm Beach, Tampa and the Keys, in Florida, US, where espresso is the preferred brewing method and an espresso brewed with sugar is termed Café Cubano, Cuban coffee, Cuban espresso, cafecito, Cuban pull, or Cuban shot.[31] Sometimes demerara sugar is used, and sometimes the sugar (white or brown) is not brewed with the coffee, but is placed in the cup as the coffee is dripped into it, then stirred into a froth.[32][33] Variations on the Miami café Cubano are with a splash of milk - cortadito; and with steamed milk - café con leche."
9,Caffè Americano,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coffee_drinks.jpg,"Caffè Americano or simply Americano (the name is also spelled with varying capitalization and use of diacritics: e.g. Café Americano, Cafe Americano, etc.) is a style of coffee prepared by adding hot water to espresso, giving a similar strength to but different flavor from brewed coffee. The drink consists of a single or double-shot of espresso combined with between 1 and 16 fluid ounces (30–470 ml) of hot water. The strength of an Americano varies with the number of shots of espresso added. In the United States, ""Americano"" is used broadly to mean combining hot water and espresso in either order. Variations include long black and lungo."
10,Vacuum coffee,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coffee_drinks.jpg,"A vacuum coffee maker brews coffee using two chambers where vapor pressure and vacuum produce coffee. This type of coffee maker is also known as vac pot, siphon or syphon coffee maker, and was invented by Loeff of Berlin in the 1830s. These devices have since been used for more than a century in many parts of the world and more recently have been given a new use by molecular mixologists and chefs to make hot cocktails and broths."
